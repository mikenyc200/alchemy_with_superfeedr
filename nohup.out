Bitcoin’s rise showed us how much demand there is for a globally accepted digital currency. However, all the things holding Bitcoin back — merchant acceptance, instant transactions (Bitcoin takes about an hour), and security — are actively being created by the world’s social network. This past March, Facebook rolled out free peer-to-peer payments and set the company down a path to into becoming one of the world’s most powerful financial institutions.\nLast year foreign workers sent $583 billion to individuals in their home countries, also known as remittances. Remittances are one of the largest financial inflows to the developing world. In some countries remittances are responsible for as much as 30% of GDP.\nHowever, sending money is expensive. The market is controlled by two companies — Western Union and MoneyGram — which hold a duopoly over the global industry. The average transfer fee is more than 8%, but fees of up to 29% are still being charged on money transfers between some countries. In a recent report, The World Bank concluded: “Forcing migrant workers to pay as much as $50 to send $200 is wrong, especially when they are sending salaries they have earned in the hope of supporting their families back home.”\nFor its part, Facebook isn’t charging fees on transfers. While the company does incur charges from banks on the back end, Facebook says it will not pass these on to the consumer. At the moment Facebook transfers are limited to users within the United States, but sources inside the company have confirmed it will expand beyond U.S. borders in the near future. It remains to be seen if Facebook will charge users a nominal fee on cross-border transfers and currency conversions, but it will likely be next to nothing. According to Steve Davis, product manager at Facebook: “We’re not trying to make a profit out of payments.”\nFacebook is already well on it’s way to becoming a global financial institution. Last summer, Financial Times discovered that Facebook is close to receiving approval from the Central Bank of Ireland to become an electronic money institution throughout Europe. This would allow users the ability to store money with the social network, transfer money to others, or buy items online.\nLong term, Facebook payments has the power to completely destroy Western Union and Money Gram (good riddance) and massively benefit millions of people in the developing world with billions of dollars more freely flowing into those countries. Facebook is in a position to control the lion’s share of remittances sent globally by offering below market-rate transfers and the best experience on mobile. It couldn’t come at a better time for the social network, which desperately needs the rest of the world to sign up in order to grow.\nThe last couple of years have been especially rough for Facebook with North America and European markets reaching saturation. There is no better way for Facebook to add new users in the developing world than by becoming the de facto app for how they receive their income from abroad.\nSomebody Yell ‘Gold Rush’\nWhile remittances open the door for growth, that possibility pales in comparison to the larger opportunity for Facebook — offering a way for people who don’t use banks now to do e-commerce. According to McKinsey, there are 2.5 billion people globally who do not use formal banks or finance institutions. Their economies are almost entirely cash-based and suffer from the chicken-and-egg problem: since no one is willing to convert cash into digital form, there is no incentive for merchants to accept electronic payments. With nothing to sustain a system of electronic money, the cycle continues.\nBut, the world is changing. In the next 5 years, nearly every person on the planet will have access to the Internet. By 2019, Ericsson predicts there will be 5.9 billion smartphone users worldwide. When every family on the planet has access to a smartphone with fast Internet, the paradigm changes. The idea that we still need physical banks, plastic cards, and paper money fades away. It’s already starting to occur. Over the Chinese New Year holiday in February, WeChat users sent over one billion “red envelopes” filled with e-money to other users.\nIt’s easy to imagine a world where workers in developing countries are paid through Facebook via peer-to-peer payments, store their money on Facebook, purchase local goods through transfers, and have the ability to pay for items using Facebook. The effect that Facebook could have on the world as an electronic financial institution is nothing short of profound.\nSo why would Facebook facilitate millions of transfers and online purchases for next to nothing? For one, it puts them closer to attaining the holy grail of data — how users spend their money. Let’s not forget that at the end of the day Facebook is most definitely an ad network at its core.\nJust because a user “likes” a brand, doesn’t mean he or she is a customer. For example, how many of Lamborghini’s 11 million Facebook fans could actually afford that car? While Facebook could make an educated guess, it can’t answer that question with certainty. However, in a world where Facebook could combine financial transactions and social graphs, advertisers would be given near-perfect information on their audience. No other ad network in the world would be able to match Facebook’s targeting capabilities — purchase behavior, income, savings, etc.\nDespite the doomsayers, the world’s future has never looked so bright. We’re currently undergoing a period of massive socioeconomic growth. In 2009 there were 1.9 billion people in the middle class and over the next 15 years that number will rise to 4.9 billion people. As billions of people rise up out of poverty to become consumers, the question presents itself — how will the new economies of the future operate? Will they still cling to the coins and paper that society has used for the last 3,500 years? Or can mobile and the Internet change all that?\nI’d like to believe the latter. While many of these ideas will take decades to come to fruition, I believe we’ll see many occur in my lifetime. Facebook has an incredible opportunity in front of itself — to use technology to change the way the world thinks about money. I quit using Facebook years ago but maybe, hopefully, Mark Zuckerberg will give me a compelling reason to sign back up.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 11

How is this possible? For a company that currently holds two out of seven top spots for highest crowdfunding projects ever: raising about $35M from its crowdsourcing efforts. Alongside a growing demand that accounted for 1M watches sold in a year (March 2013-March 2014). Pebble should be on the upswing with all this news as its managed to prove itself able to hold its own in a market that faces increased competition with each passing day.\nRumors and speculations have been abound that Pebble saw its orders plummet when Apple announced its Apple Watch back in April. With Apples watch supply selling out and pushing back delivery times until as late as June. And even on that news there has been debate as to whether the Apple Watch itself is going to prove a consumer success or just a passing fad. What we do know is that Apple Watches, based on preorders alone (with most recent numbers being a few months old), outsold the entire Pebble lineup. With consumer interest in Apple and its ability to tie in its watch to the core of its ecosystem a much meatier selling point than Pebbles rather limited access to core iPhone functions. It’s not to say that Pebble lost the market, but rather this market is going through a period of adjustment as companies with much deeper pockets come into play.\nNews came from TechCrunch  recently hinting that it might be fiscal problems that hinder Pebble’s ambitions. With TechCrunch reporting:\n“According to sources close to the company, the company is having trouble maintaining its growth and has turned to a Silicon Valley bank for a $5 million loan and $5 million line of credit. Valley VCs have been turning down the company’s requests for new capital.”\nWhich leads me to believe that as Apple and Google (with its army of OEM’s using Android) enter the smartwatch market in force they are going to squeeze out much smaller indie companies that made their niche; much like how corporate chains squeezed out mom-and-pop coffee houses. Making companies, like Pebble, appear to be much more risky investments in the face of entrenched global powerhouses who will throw unfathomable amounts of money into R&D, marketing and sex appeal to sell the damn things.\nIt’s going to be hard for Pebble to live off of the goodwill of crowdfunding and “minimal” sales to sustain itself. It’s going to be harder when it’s going to be tough to find credit as its becoming seen as a risky investment.\nAnd it’s going to be impossible to compete as Apple and Google control the ecosystem behind the markets.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 12

Leaving us with another year of disappointment with the Wii U, a few standout first-party titles pending. Hurting many who long to see Nintendo recapture the momentum it had back in the heyday of the Wii era, or the aggressive posturing of the N64. Yet giving us at least a year to think about what we really want to see from a new Nintendo machine. And as I was working in my service industry job today I happened to have some thoughts popping in my head, scattered ideas, that would make me (a PS4 gamer) reinvest my limited income into a Nintendo machine.\nWith the first being a guaranteed hardware boost. Where Nintendo takes this hardware on the technical front remains to be heard, but I’m going to assume that they want to compete or outshine the likes of the PS4 and Xbox One on the console front while making whatever device it becomes able to compete with mid-range PC’s. Even though at this point the Wii U can push some impressive (but selectively limited) boosts on Xbox 360 era hardware to 1080p 60FPS. This is all a given. What I would love to see is for Nintendo to push the ideas presented in the Wii U and DS line into something truly futuristic.\nTake the Nvidia Shield, a recently announced Android device, that can play 4K content and games through a streaming service.\nA machine that packs more power than most “current” generation consoles through the power of the Cloud provided that the Internet connection is stable and fast. Able to play games like Borderlands, Crysis 3, KotoR and vast swaths of the PC ecosystem without much of a pause. Not on the level of $1000+ gaming rigs, but good enough for most consumers.\nI mention this only because as Nintendo looks to build its console there is something enticing and very very risky about ditching the very idea of a centralized physical machine. Instead taking your hardware to the cloud. Enabling you, the consumer, to access your games anywhere that has a connection and a screen. Building out the potential shown in that plasticky looking tablet that you shipped with the Wii U. With the console itself becoming little more than a receiver of sorts to the services while providing some localized support in handling the data.\nOr.\nNintendo could go full awesome and open themselves up to the potential of a service that could offer the same game on nearly any compatible platform provided we stick with the idea of the Cloud. With an app on iOS or compatible Android devices that could breath new life into its gaming space while having the potential to entice billions of new customers. With the issue of controller compatibility being solved with a universal Nintendo controller of sorts. Or just sending out an update for the Wii U Pro Controller Game Pad that would make it bluetooth compatible for most smartphones. And sell a little attachment thing so we could put our phones on it.\nSony already has the controller attachment thingamajig figured out.\nWrapping this hardware idea around it seems like my fantasy for new Nintendo hardware lies in my desire to see them push beyond the conventional limitations of the traditional console to create something more accessible through unconventional methods. In the process potentially cannibalizing two of their own products: the Wii U and 3DS.\nNone of this can happen without games.\nWhile there is no denying the quality of Nintendo’s first-party software Nintendo severely underestimated just how essential third-party titles would become to the health of a consoles’ ecosystem. With Nintendo each new blockbuster that doesn’t come to the Wii U platform is another lost sale to a customer who has to decide where to invest their cash. Over the past two years the number of non-Nintendo blockbusters trickling to the Wii U has been nothing more than a rain droplet on a scorched Sahara desert.\nThe switch to the x86 architecture at this point is a given, a necessity given that Nintendo is the last company to use the PowerPC architecture. Which really makes porting games a pain in the ass. Even better since the hardware on the Wii U is comparable to the PS3/Xbox 360. So as developers phase out those two older systems (PS3/Xbox360) more rapidly than anticipated there is almost no hope of a worthwhile Wii U downgrade of any blockbuster unless you’re a CoD fan. And if that’s the case then I doubt you’d be using a Wii U.\nThe point I’m trying to make?\nNintendo: You need more (I debated throwing the word “fuck” in here to make it sound more serious) games to sell more consoles.\nI don’t know why I need to even say that to a video game company, but I do, so pay up. I’ll send you an invoice for that sentence of consulting work.\nEmbrace the creativity of other publishers: whether independent indies or the likes of EA and such. Stuff yourself with diverse content that dip into multiple genres. Make it so we don’t have to worry about the availability of games. Speaking as a gamer I’d kill to be able to jump from the new Battlefront game into Mario Kart. And if your hardware is cheap enough with content available I’m sure many of us would jump ship. With the biggest barrier being your scattershot excuse for a unified online strategy.\nI really have no idea how the hell your user base tolerates your poor excuse for online options. In a world with Playstation Network, Steam and Xbox Live; the idea of downgrading myself into something that feels like a 2004 demo of a concept in progress for a future system that somehow lived to 2015 sounds like my idea of purgatory. I know your Nintendo Network has potential, but you’ve fallen so far behind the times in both simple profile unification, design, basic ideas and content offerings that it’s nothing short of a laughable embarrassment to the modern gaming community.\nFix it.\nFix it.\nFix it.\nSony did with Playstation Network.\nMake Nintendo Network the backbone to the future of your push forward through seamless profile unification alongside a tsunami of improvements to help gamers connect to the social, multimedia and multiplayer experiences that your games cry for and a modern audience all but requires. Give us something that can stream Netflix without the frustrations of poor design alongside engaging Communists in the large scale battles in Battlefield. Let us play Mario Party with friends then when everyone leaves let us duke it out in Destiny. Let us watch porn if we want. Why should you care?\nOk. Fair point: children.\nWhen you setup a gaming machine you’re usually given settings to make sure the system in question is either for an adult or a child. Let us deal with the repercussions. You take care of making the backend of things work (phrasing). Because it’s anti-consumer and hurts the overall appeal of your platform if you are going to try to parent us into using a console with a predefined set of uses.\nOr do I need to bring your Youtube fiasco into this……\nAs I look to the future of where gaming is going I see an opportunity for you to reengineer yourself into something that embraces and emboldens current trends within the gaming market. With a unique opportunity to capitalize on your unrivaled content catalogue and sense of fun to push the boundaries of conventional gaming is. What I talked about above is nothing more than the thoughts of a gamer who wants nothing more than to see your recapture your creative spark that brought you to your Golden Age in the 1990\'s.\nYou’ve redefined gaming once.\nThis may be your last.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 13

By being unable to foresee the consumer revolution of the smartphone that the iPhone brought about Microsoft found itself scrambling. And then Google got involved with its Android OS by making it free to manufacturers. Which is really the point where, as the cool kids say, “shit hit the fan”.\nWithin four years Microsoft’s attempts at re-entering the smartphone market (with Windows Phone) had become a running joke amongst all but the most devote Microsoft holdout as iOS and Android further entrenched themselves in the hands of consumers. The Windows Phones sold, but at that point (2011/2012) they were competing for marketshare with BlackBerry and the remaining Palm holdouts, a whooping 3–5% marketshare while Apple and Google were fighting over the remaining 97–95% marketshare. With an ailing Nokia famously adopting Windows Phone to become the standard across its mobile line after several failed modernization efforts with its in-house Symbian platform. Leading Nokia’s already struggling empire to collapse in the face of more robust Android smartphones that were infinitely cheaper on the low end and the high end of the market to go to Apple. Times were bleak. And somehow managed to get worse.\nWithin six years the remaining hardware partners Microsoft had were either bailing on Windows Phone after poor sales or on the verge of bankruptcy like Nokia. Or both really. With the swan song of Steve Ballmers tenure at Microsoft being a buyout of Nokia Mobile as one last hail-marry attempt to keep the ill-fated dream of a Windows Phone empire alive. While the buyout happened there was a lot of damage to both brands and the struggle of incorporating a whole new organization into an already overextended Microsoft. Leaving Windows Phone to sit almost stagnate even to this very day, almost two years later. Rumors swirled about Nokia’s plans to ditch Windows Phone for Android and the layoff of thousands as Microsoft tried to give itself a direction with its mobile efforts.\nAs each attempt to inject Windows Phone with momentum fell flat and further pushed the core user base away as Microsofts traditional business partners (and businesses at large) became accepting of the smartphone revolution. Pushing the idea of the OS as the core of the workplace away as the demand for more flexible software that could run across all devices came into play. Leaving more openings for nimble upstarts and traditional corporate giants alike to rebuild the workflow of the modern workplace. Or even the way people interact with the environments around them. In many ways Microsoft should’ve (and now is) put its efforts: software and services that become the backbone of the modern mobile world. Making up the lost revenue in hardware from software sales and services on the dominant rival platforms.\nAt the launch of the much anticipated Samsung Galaxy S6 it was revealed that Microsoft had scored a major upset on Google by having Microsoft’s services preinstalled by default on a device that was powered by Android. Being that the Samsung Galaxy line has come to be the flagship of the Android world, with preorders and expected sales in the tens of millions, the door is wide open for Microsoft’s competing services to take market and mindshare away from Google’s software lockdown of the consumer space. Underscoring how little control Google has over Android and highlighting that Microsoft is willing to fight wherever it needs on whatever platform to have itself heard. With iOS also getting several of Microsofts core apps that had previously been locked into Windows Phone exclusively. Optimistic news to say the least, but highlighting the current uncertainty with Windows Phone.\nAs it stands, in 2015, Windows Phone appears to be dead in the water. With Microsoft’s plans to unify its Windows platform across devices: tablet, desktop, laptop, Xbox and phone casting aside the need for Windows Phone to be a separate product but rather just Windows. A near abandonment of the future that Microsoft spend years trying to build in the tradition of itself, Apple or Google. Instead Microsoft has refocused itself and Windows around the progressive idea of a uniform platform. Successfully breaking off the most desirable parts of Windows and freed them to be accessible on almost any platform, opening it up to billions of users.\nThe future of Windows Phone isn’t Windows Phone or Windows itself.\nThe future is the services it once incubated set free to this brave new world.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 14

At last glance I was getting ready to write up a glaring critique of your mishandling of you mobile division. And I was about three clicks away from blasting you on the design of your new flagship smartphones (the Galaxy S6(Edge)). But at this point I’ve been following you long enough (since my senior year of high-school in 2009/2010) to know that your workings as a company are way more complex than a reactionist post can properly frame. So I’ve waited.\nAs the reviews of your Galaxy S6, and its more premium brother the Galaxy S6 Edge, have been published I must say that for the first time in years you’ve caught me off-guard. With a well received smartphone that is a direct manifestation of all the lessons learned after years of becoming complacent as the market leader. This is an age in which you’ve managed to decimate your competition globally and even managing to threaten Googles hold on the very idea of Android. Yet beyond the behemoth that you’ve built lies trouble as your competition retools and rebuilds into something that, for the first time in four years, threatens your hegemony. The Galaxy S6 and the Edge stand as your product that needs to shore up and expand upon your ideas that you are trying to sell to the consumer.\nThe Galaxy S6 (Edge) feel like the phone(s) we should’ve seen last year with a design that does wonders to correct the band-aid look that came to be a running joke in some circles. Replacing the stopgap that was known as the Galaxy S5.\nCausing me to lose myself in thought wondering what the outcome of last year would’ve been had we seen this (Galaxy S6) labeled “Galaxy S5”. Because in all honesty fiscal 2014 wasn’t kind. Your smartphone division faced unparalleled competition amongst shifting trends that caused a near collapse in your most important markets. Causing a chain reaction within the free-fall that led to you playing defensive for the first time since WebOS was still a thing. Right now, off the top of my head, there are three things that stood out to me from the previous year that led you to this point.\nApple released two larger smartphones: The iPhone 6 (Plus) were Apple responding to the demands of the market. After years of claiming that the consumer space didn’t need or want larger phones they finally caved. Cashing out in the process with unseen sales and preorders. As it stands that happened to be the area where you were strongest with your battles early on, Samsung, by listening to the desires of the smartphone adopters with your Note line. Taking the risks to think beyond the proven sizes and redefine what was possible with proper research. Proving first and foremost that big screens, on phone, were/are awesome for doing mobile things. But at the same time a lot of people wanted a larger phone from Apple. Not you. Which means that a lot of consumers held out. And this came at a point of saturation/maturation within the Western markets. Leading to……\nThe end of the Smartphone boom: Is this a real thing? I think so. Because early on in the smartphone wars everyone aside from Apple spent the better half of two years flooding the markets with phones that had no grand vision aside from a stopgap for something better that ended up being released six months after the last best thing was released. With many Americans being tied to two-year contracts and Europe in a recession (but hey, at least they don’t have two-year contracts) the only thing sustaining those levels of growth were the affordable costs provided by a highly competitive market space. And it came to an end in 2014 as consumers, after two years of confusion and impulse, realized what they needed in a smartphone: stability, reliability, quality and support. After being burned by the boom many simply looked to higher quality products like Apple (who is still supporting the iPhone 4s) and your Galaxy line that gave the promise of a device above the petty smartphone squabbles. This shift left many smartphone companies teetering on the verge of bankruptcy, being sold for scraps or getting by on “minimal” profit because after two years of racing to the bottom they couldn’t afford to rise to the top. Forcing those that survived the bloodshed to look beyond the horizons of The West to new markets that happened to be heating up under their noses.\nThe rise of Xiaomi: When I say Xiaomi is a threat, I really shouldn’t say a threat to your global ambitions (due to various laws imposed by Governments), but rather the more lethal kind. A competitor that’s more localized and nimble tapping into an untapped market that it “gets”. Through simply knowing the “ins” and “outs” of the region and able to expand itself alongside its brand on a more nationalistic front. Much like cars to Americans in the 20th century, for many in the East the development of local smartphone manufacturers is becoming a source of pride. Giving the consumers in the region(s) an investment in their identity as something they can showcase with enthusiasm against the backdrop of foreign goods. It’s pretty awesome to see from a development standpoint but a problem when that market, in this case China, happens to be one of the largest growing economies in the world. Enriching the lives of hundreds of millions with money that can be used to purchase goods. It’s what has made Xiaomi such a threat to the established hegemony despite having almost no presence outside China.\nWhile there are probably more factors involved I can’t help but feel, that knowing your history, those are the big three that have shaped your recent actions to finally address all your shortcomings to your premium smartphone lineup. Because you’ve done wonders in course correction with the Galaxy S6 that finally make you a player in the premium marketplace. And, as much of a downer as this may sound, there is something about the refinement of your Galaxy line that makes it stand out even less than it has in previous generations.\nBelow are four flagship smartphones.\nAnd, what the hell? I’ll include this fella.\nFour flagship phones. All with nearly the same…..\nNever mind that aside from the iPhone all run Android in some variant. What I’m trying to get at is that in 2015 the smartphone marketplace looks nearly the same with such small tweaks to the underlying phones that at this point in time you’d just be picking hairs to make a truly compelling case between any four of the smartphones because all will do what you need.\nIt’s the reality of the current market that you’re walking into Samsung. As much as I’m going to sound like a hypocrite I can’t help but wish that your design of the Galaxy S6 had done a little more unconventional instead of caving to the conventional demands that have erroded any sense of playful exploration of what a smartphone should be. You held out for ages on removable memory, swappable batteries and I’m sure other less important things; but those parts came to gave you an identity as the industry was gentrifying.\nAnd when I’m walking through a store, as I often do when I need something to take my mind off of life, I see a wave of screens flickering like the dim lights in a hallway. Nearly indistinguishable as they all form a universal appeal.\nWhy can’t yours standout?\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 15

But, what caught my interest even more was the link he left at the end of his tweet. The link is for a website called “Homescreen.is,” and it provides an iOS app that serves as a “tool for sharing your homescreen and discovering apps.”\nThe #Homescreen iOS app, once installed, will analyze your iPhone’s homescreen and deduce which of your apps are most popular relative to those apps found on other users’ homescreens. In essence, it provides an insightful glimpse into understanding which apps individuals covet and value the most.\nHere is a breakdown of the popularity of Mr. Hemeon’s homepage apps, as provided by Homescreen.is, as of March 27th, 2015:\nIf we solely constructed Hemeon’s “top 4” apps by only consulting this data, then the “Slack” and “Watchville” apps would be replaced with the “Photos” (64.01%) and “Camera” (54.91%) apps. The “Phone” (85.43%) and the “Messages” (75.87%) apps would remain in the “top 4.”\nBut, while the stats say that “Slack” and “Watchville” have no business being in Hemeon’s (or any of our) “Top 4” apps, their presence, in Hemeon’s case, is explainable. Hemeon is a serial entrepreneur and a product designer. As a result, he keeps in touch and communicates with hundreds (if not thousands) of people throughout the course of a day. Accordingly, an app such as “Slack” centered around making our communications more efficient and streamlined would be invaluable for someone such as Marc Hemeon. The “Watchville” app, on the other hand, is the creation of a company called North Technologies and the co-founder of the company is Mr. Hemeon himself.\nSo, what conclusions of value can we draw from a website such as Homescreen.is that categorizes the most popular apps?\nLuckily, as I was stuck in a rut trying to figure out what these stats explained, I came across a YouTube video that featured entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuck, who was giving a promotional interview for his most recent book “Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook.” Midway through the video, Gary V said the following:\n“There’s only three things on your phone.\n1) Escapism and entertainment.\n2) Information and utility.\n3) Social (People).\nNobody has anything else on the homepage of their phone.”\nI thought to myself: “Really? Could Gary V be on to something here? I wonder what types of apps my friends have on their phones? And, how do these apps rank on Homescreen.is?”\nThis prompted me to ask a few friends of mine to send me a screenshot of the homepage of their phone. Specifically, I wanted the page that contained the apps they used the most (so this didn’t necessarily have to be the “homepage,” but just a page that housed their most frequented apps).\nAccordingly, to provide for some variety, I asked five iOS and five Android users to send me their homepage screenshots. Here are the five iOS users’ homepages:\nThe five Android users’ homepages:\nIt seems Gary Vaynerchuk’s comments seem to fit the bill. As you can see, most of the apps between the ten users relate to social media/communication (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Skype, Slack, Email), entertainment (YouTube, ESPN), utility (Uber, Flashlight, Camera, Phone, Messages), escapism (Spotify, Pandora), and information (Podcasts, ESPN Radio, SoundCloud, Kindle, SmartNews, Maps).\nHomescreen.is has a page on its website that aggregates the most used apps of all of the user submitted homepages. Then, the site creates a dynamic listing of the most popular apps. In a sense, this is the ‘perfect homepage to have’ since these are the apps that are found on most users’ homepages. Of course, while this listing contains many apps that exist for both Android and iOS, there are some apps that are exclusively available for only iOS devices.\nEvidently, Gary V’s remarks are apparent in this Homescreen.is ranking as well.\nIf we study the Homescreen.is “most popular apps” list carefully, we notice that those apps tend to find ways to consistently reacquaint us with three of our most primitive traits as human beings: communication, discovery, and adaptability.\nFrom our earliest days on this planet, it is well documented (cave paintings) that we love to share stories and communicate with one another. The popularity of apps such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Slack attest to this basic human desire. Did you know that there are individuals out there who have created a successful career by only creating Vine videos? Unreal. But, that’s the priority we give to our daily communications.\nHowever, our communications are not always drawn out and deeply involved. Sometimes we converse with one another by our actions or facial expressions. This is where apps like Snapchat have “filled the void” by embracing the concept of ephemeral communication.\nDiscovery is an integral part of being a human being. We love to discover what people have sent us (email and Facebook Messenger) and we enjoy discovering what is going on around the world (Twitter and news gathering apps). This is why LinkedIn has been so successful. In addition to providing a career profile for each user, it has an in-built social networking system that allows users to connect with one another. LinkedIn leverages the notion that most of us are connected with one another by six or seven other people. This means if we just know some well-connected individuals on LinkedIn, then we have a direct link to many of the world’s most powerful leaders.\nThe third human trait that successful apps have is adaptability. Many people incorrectly believe Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection claims that “only the strongest survive.” That’s not true. Only those strongly adaptable to change survive. Being strong guarantees momentary survival, being adaptable, however, means you will survive anything due to your ability to adjust to a constantly shifting environment. Any app that can re-invent itself perpetually will have a place in our hearts.\nAngry Birds is a great example of being adaptable to the changing times. The creators of the gaming app realized that people were ravenously addicted, but how can those users keep coming back for more? By adding the component of ‘perfection’ into the game:\n“When you can pinpoint where you went wrong, this is called a near miss. It’s used all the time in terms of how scratch cards and slot machines are designed. When we fail to win, we create a reason in our mind why we didn’t. The losses effectively become near-wins and feel ‘cognitively frustrating’. And the only way you can get rid of that frustration is to go back to the start and play again.”\nSo, in this case, Rovio, the company that designed and created the Angry Birds apps, realized that they didn’t even have to necessarily create a new version of the game to appease the fans of the game. They simply had to make going through the game with perfection the highest of accolades. That’s smart thinking and adaptability at its finest.\nWith newer apps like Meerkat and Periscope fighting it out to gain both users and market share, it is readily apparent that implementing the basic tenets of human psychology into apps will be one of the most important tasks for potential new entrants into an already crowded app environment.\nNOTE: A huge ‘thank you’ goes out to everyone who submitted a screenshot of their homepage to me.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 16

I’m never sure my e-mails are really sent, and typing is really not good. Why did they have to give us those *expletive*ing machines?”\nI looked around in the meeting room, and noticed a familiar sight. In front of each person lay, neatly set on the table, an iPhone piled upon another, bigger iPhone. The smaller of the two was in the company standard issue plastic case; the bigger one had a fancier shell.\nI wondered: if they really hate their (professional) iPhones, why in the world would they want to inflict it upon themselves as a personal smartphone?\nOr more to the point: what is this gap between personal and corporate use, that Apple is still unable to bridge ?\nDisclaimer: the following conclusions are drawn from a small sample of observations, i.e. a dozen or so colleagues and friends working at various European companies, as well as my own experience. However the feedback is consistent enough, so that I allowed myself to extrapolate a bit the data.\nThis is about real money\nThe corporate market for mobile devices is worth billions of dollars, and Apple’s leadership has big plans there.\nSome changes in corporate purchasing have already opened the door. In some companies, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies allow employees’ personal choices to determine the professional device they use ; in others, senior management themselves push towards the products they know and like, based on personal use.\nWhich means that\nHere, the huge iOS app store doesn’t play a decisive role in user adoption. When a device is imposed on corporate employees, they start using it half-heartedly for its basic functionality. They stay a long time in first-party apps, and only start looking at those fancy to-do list applications and minimalist productivity tools once they are convinced that the device “works” for them. And if they own a smartphone for their personal use, they may stick to it and never use the pro one for anything beyond email.\nBut other factors are key in the iPhone user experience:\nA professional smartphone is (still) an e-mail machine\nThe first reason why employees are given smartphones is to be able to respond their e-mail when out of the office.\nIn the professional context, it has to work flawlessly. Any lost stuff can create a real, serious problem.\nThis is why we don’t tolerate the same level of flaws and glitches in a pro Device. Instead of, say, 99% reliability for a personal machine, we accept nothing below 99,99%, and even then, will complain loudly about the 0,01% of problems.\nI also suspect, without data to back it up, that the enterprise set-up of e-mail is also a culprit: it is a more complicated thing than just linking your IMAP account, especially due to the constraints of information security.\nIf Apple wants to take hold in the enterprise market with the same qualities that propelled the iPhone at the top of customer satisfaction charts, they need to improve significantly the reliability of their standard mail app, which is the one people use most.\nI accept the notion that e-mail is a concept of the past, and that dedicated apps could, in the long run, replace many of its uses. Innovators and start-ups may be pioneering new tools and uses; however, the hard reality of most corporations today is that notifications, requests, work, information and documents are still circulated by way of e-mail.\nWe expect a lot from our professional calendar app\nHere MS Outlook is the reference for most users, and this software, for all its limitations, is very capable. Of course the comparison of a mobile app with a desktop app is unfair, but the existence of a calendar app on the smartphone means that people can, and will, compare.\nIn particular, I have heard — and felt — frustration about the limited options to answer to an invitation, check availability, and selectively update meetings. This functionality gap is blaring.\nTyping on glass still sucks\nWhere Blackberry was renowned for the quality of physical keyboards, Apple and their Android followers have bet the house on the fact that typing is so 2000. Now we can do everything with a few taps and voice commands !\nIt may be true for private uses, but wherever intensive e-mailing remains the norm, the experience suffers. Not to mention those old iPhones without TouchID, which you have to manually unlock by typing, several times a day, the same long-but-secure password… Even a seasoned glass typist will make mistakes, and the frustration quickly adds up.\nA better predictive typing would go a long way. The existing software does usually a decent job, but there are a lot of online collections of its most funny errors that show how much room for improvement remains.\nTime to regroup?\nApple has made a lot of progress towards mass adoption of their products in the enterprise, but numbers don’t tell the whole story. Their position does not look as strong as in the consumer market, the fit with use cases remains inconsistent; if they were able to run satisfaction surveys focusing on the professional use of their mobile devices, I suspect the results would be disappointing.\nA large part of the problem is about making existing functionalities work more reliably. This topic resonates with the recent “high functional ground” online discussion : concern is rising among developers and specialists about the deteriorating fit and finish of Apple software.\nA gap in software quality would open a window of opportunity for competitors to seize, and nowhere is it as obvious as in the corporate context.\nOver the past years, the development of smartphones was spurred to a large extent by a features race between iOS and Android. As the market matures and differentiation by features becomes harder, stabilizing and consolidating the product might actually be the right choice to keep growing.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 17

Becoming downright hostile towards the idea of ISPs having the ability to prioritize services on the Internet which would become the undoing of the open Internet that has become a necessity to the modern interconnected world. It was this in mind that while I was slaving away at my service industry job that I began to think about the future. How this Internet of Things is on the cusp of making the leap from the simple ideas of web viewing to the larger ideas of automation and other complex ideas that require more reliability than simply viewing a Facebook post. In this world as we move forward I can see my views on Net-Neutrality shifting.\nLet me explain.\nFor example: there is a difference between viewing a Reddit post and having a smart-car automatically drive you to your location. Yet both under current laws would be treated the same as they both use the Internet to connect to all the glorious stuff that makes them work. In my view this shouldn’t be viewed as the same web traffic because the Reddit post is being used to view a (hilarious) dog GIF and the smart-car is being used to navigate a family of four through suburban gridlock. Both require an Internet connection but one is built to ensure the safe passage of its users. Expanding beyond the smart-car idea is the push for total integration of the smart-home and interconnected devices to give you constant feedback or control over whatever it is you own.\nThe next wave of Internet won’t be built from the traditional viewership of page views and advertisements. Instead this new wave will be built into real world applications and appliances. Things and stuff that need to have the best available connection and data access to ensure the security of these larger, more individualized, systems being built for the global consumer. With the constant threat of hackers and potential failures these systems need to have the garauntee of security and reliability built in without anyone having the ability to second guess these products. The moment something goes wrong as this wave sweeps through the consumer space is the moment we have to rethink how these things will work.\nWith those thoughts in mind I do believe that their needs to be a fast-lane option available for key devices and systems to be able to tap into as a means to ensure the most reliable connections available. I still believe that the traditional Internet of page views and media consumption should abide by the Net-Neutrality laws set in place. However as we move beyond that framework we need to accept that not all traffic is created equal. It’s one thing to post a Youtube link to a friends Facebook and another to have your entire home wired for the digital future.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 18[0m

It has always been easy to find live videos from people you know—Periscope connects to the Twitter social graph, so it can send you an alert when someone in your network is live—but finding streams from strangers has been difficult. Previously, live feeds from around the world appeared as a list of thumbnails and titles.\n\n\nThe iOS update today also adds the option to tweet a link to any Periscope broadcast, making it easier to share videos you are watching.\n\n\nLast week, Twitter released Periscope for Android, three months after the app debuted on iOS.

Or are they? Sure, you may adore a Cézanne still-life while your friend absolutely hates it. But research has shown that many people share certain aesthetic preferences, such as landscape paintings and the color blue. Human biology may help explain why.\nA new study out of Yahoo Labs looked at what kind of aesthetics attract people, using a relatively new tool: digital photo filters. The researchers wanted to know whether manipulated images on the web engage people more than unfiltered ones. They assessed 7.6 million photos from Instagram and Flickr, and controlled for variables like the number of followers and how many tags a photo had. The results showed a distinct difference: people are 21% more likely to view filtered photos and 45% more likely to comment on them, compared to regular photos.\nOne reason for this difference might be that filters help tell a story. \"People are adding filters to try and match the narrative that’s in their head at the time when they take the shot,\" says David Ayman Shamma, one of the study authors. Someone might choose a faded, scratched filter for a photo of a favorite old bar, and this old-timey effect supports the viewer’s understanding of the image. If a filter lets our brains process the content of a photo more easily (something called \"perceptual fluency\"), it can make us like the image more.\nFilters may also stir up emotions that draw people to the image. The study authors note this connection—their findings mirror other studies showing that emotional response drives people’s engagement in social media. \"Filters could have an effect on how the viewer feels,\" explains Oshin Vartanian, a psychologist who studies cognitive neuroscience at the University of Toronto Scarborough, and who wasn’t involved in the study. \"And there’s strong evidence for a link between an emotional response and aesthetic preferences.\"\nThe Yahoo Labs study is just the latest addition to centuries of thought on aesthetics—scientific and otherwise. In another (mostly tongue-in-cheek) attempt to identify people’s artistic tastes, two Russian artists surveyed people in 10 countries in the 1990s to find out their \"most wanted\" and \"least wanted\" paintings. The pair polled over 10,000 people in China, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Kenya, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States about their aesthetic preferences by asking questions like \"What’s your favorite color?\" and \"Do you prefer indoor or outdoor scenes?\"\nThe survey results revealed that people across the world generally liked—and disliked—many of the same things in artwork. All 10 countries preferred the color blue, which isn’t a surprise. Studies dating back to the 1940s have shown people presented with a palette of colors typically choose blue as their favorite. The prevalent theory to explain this: People subconsciously associate colors with things of the same color that they’ve seen in the past. So when someone sees the color blue, it reminds them of pleasant blue skies and clear water, and this influences their preference for it. Blue skies and clear water also have a universally positive association, which may explain why so many people across different cultures prefer blue.\nThe survey also found that people generally didn’t like the color yellow, a trend seen in other research. Negative associations probably explain our aversion to yellow: \"Colors are a function of the experiences we’ve had, and speak to our shared environment,\" explains Vartanian. \"People tend to dislike colors in yellow—dark yellow in particular—because it’s typically associated with disease and various undesirable things we’ve come into contact with in the past.\"\nThe 1990s survey also found that most countries (except one) favored landscape paintings. Several decades of research have similarly identified the same preference for open countryside, green grass, trees, water—your standard landscape painting. The popular argument says this Savanna-like landscape speaks to our evolutionary history and basic survival instincts. \"We tend to prefer open environments that allow us to look for resources and watch for predators, as well as the ability to hide from predators (like in a tree),\" Vartanian says. \"If it looks like the kind of environment in which you could survive and thrive, you’re going to have an aesthetic preference for it.\" This mental assessment occurs whether you realize it or not, and whether you’re looking at the actual scene or just a painting of a landscape.\nThe majority of people surveyed for the project also disliked abstract art, and favored curvy lines over sharp, jagged lines—both inclinations likely rooted in how the brain works. Our preference for curvy lines is supported by almost a century of psychological studies, and scientists have found it’s rooted in an evolutionary bias as well. Research has found that when people look at a sharp object in an MRI scanner, it activates a region of the brain (called the amygdala) that responds to danger, whereas curved objects don’t elicit this mental reaction. \"Sharp objects in our past were associated with danger,\" Vartanian says. \"This association has stayed with us, even though the environment we live in today is quite different.\"\nAnd as for abstract art: Well, it’s not hard to figure out why many people don’t like it. An abstract painting is highly conceptual, which means it takes a lot more energy to understand, whereas representational art has a storyline that the viewer can immediately follow. Similar to the photo filters, we typically prefer images that are easier to process. Vartanian notes that this bias doesn’t apply to people trained in visual arts—they tend to like abstract art much more. And there’s a lot of data showing that people with expertise in visual arts perceive paintings very differently overall than someone untrained, so their aesthetic preferences probably differ from the average person in general.\nWhile research has discovered some overarching aesthetic preferences, our artistic tastes will always vary from person to person. \"I think that’s one of the dangers of this research,\" says Bevil Conway, a neuroscientist at Wellesley Collge, \"You don’t want to be like some scientists who say that making great work requires X, Y, and Z, and ‘Here are the 13 things that make a great picture.’\" Because obviously, blue landscapes aren’t everyone’s favorite type of painting—it’s far more complicated than that.\nOoh, behold the Holy Data.  And yet the most successful brands do not necessarily use blue for their logo. And if abstract art gives people headaches, are we supposed to put Smurfs pics all over our pages ? Aesthetics, and art in general IS NOT science by definition. If this were the case, people would have step away from McDonald\'s restaurants, Shell Gas stations and NYC cabs.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 20

The hoverboard incorporates four round engines below the board, creating a magnetic field that lets it hover an inch above a copper surface. The MFA technology works much the same way, but on a bigger scale, Henderson suggested.\n\n\nAccording to Arx Pax’s patent for the three-part foundation, buildings with the system have a \"containment vessel\" that is meant to keep everything above it in place during the lateral movements of an earthquake.\n\n\nHenderson said that the system could be applied to an existing building if its foundation is significantly retrofitted. But he admitted that it would be preferable to include it in all-new construction. He also said that no one has yet integrated Arx Pax’s system in buildings of any kind. \"We’re looking for that forward-thinking partner,\" he said, \"who wants to build more safely.\"\n\n\nThere are current anti-shaking technologies, known as \"base isolation\" systems, that are designed to dramatically slow a building’s movement in an earthquake. But Henderson argued that those systems are expensive and don’t stop the shaking. His method, by contrast, is designed to keep everything exactly in place for about the same cost as base isolation.\n\n\nFor those in earthquake zones, such a technology sounds too good to be true. And since no one has yet incorporated it into a building, it’s hard to say for sure if it would work. But in a release, Arx Pax quoted University of California at Berkeley Seismological Laboratory external relations officer Jennifer Strauss as saying that Arx Pax’s technology, \"combined with the ShakeAlert early-warning system, will allow state-of-the-art seismic protection and vibration control for buildings, operating rooms, highly calibrated instruments, and much more.\"\n\n\nFtCo,\n\n\nPerhaps I\'m not seeing proprietary devices but a suspended building with  a high center of gravity, unequal loading  (a conventional house as shown  having movable furniture can never be balanced),  there are no apparent devices to keep it centered, and with a flat bottom  is likely to capsize easily.   The static design may need reconsideration. \n\n\nAs well, the suspension system is (responsively) static and a  static system can not respond well to a dynamic system. An earthquakes, as they comprise  both wave and field motions that vary in frequency, periodicity, and amplitude is a very dynamic 4D system.  See YouTube videos of the behavior of water in pools during earthquakes and note \"splashing up over the side\".   Wave motion in a contained volume might actually amplify rather than dampen  the forces on the suspended object.\n\n\nThe  basic principle could be made to work, but the devices and system would be quite  different. \n\n\nPoultry Motors and Design\n\n\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 21

You collect each season from the farm, you grade it, and whatever the best grade is, that\'s what you\'ve got and those are the properties you have.\"\nFor decades, researchers have been fascinated by the properties of silk as a material. Spider silk, for example, is famously stronger than steel by weight. But until recently, it\'s been difficult to create an artificial version.\nNow, like Bolt Threads, a number of biotech companies, such as Kraig Biocraft Labs and the Japanese company Spiber, are close to or starting to produce commercial products. They want to use the material to create everything from bulletproof vests to surgical sutures.\n\"Advances in DNA sequencing since the 1990s opened the door to tuned properties, but there were many pieces of the puzzle that had to be solved in order to do it consistently, at scale, and at a cost that made it commercially viable,\" says Widmaier.\nThe startup uses yeast engineered to make silk protein, and grows it in fermenters similar to what you\'d find in a brewery making beer. After purifying the protein away from the yeast, they spin it using a process similar to making rayon or nylon. The result is engineered silk.\nIt can look and feel exactly like fabric made using silkworms—but it can also be better, both because it can avoid the unpredictability of the natural production process, and because the proteins can be engineered to have whatever qualities an apparel company wants.\n\"Silk today is a fiber that\'s the ultimate luxury fiber, it\'s soft, it\'s strong, it drapes really well, it\'s got a great luster to it, and that\'s great,\" says Widmaier. \"But it\'s also fragile and doesn\'t care for well, it yellows over time, and there\'s all these things that are wrong with it as well.

Loads of research says that daylight, plants, and even pictures of the outdoors can help people get more done. But the newest co-working space in London goes a little farther: It\'s actually outside, in a tree. And every time you pay rent, the tree takes the proceeds.\n\"As a place to work, I can\'t think of a better office,\" says artist, engineer, and New York University professor Natalie Jeremijenko, who designed TreeXOffice in an East London park called Hoxton Square. \"It\'s a beautiful, airy, delicious space in amongst the chaos of public space.\"\nSix to eight people can work in the tree at any given time, using the tree\'s new Wi-Fi and power supply. And while it\'s arguably a better workspace for freelancers than the typical office in a high-rise, the art project is equally beneficial for the park. Legally, the tree acts as the landlord, and all of the membership fees will be reinvested to make the tree and its surroundings healthier.\n\"The profits from the tree are spent in the interest of the tree,\" says Jeremijenko. \"By making it specifically about the tree, and the kind of revenue that the tree can generate, we\'re really exploring a larger political discussion of what are the rights of nature.\"\nThe usual way of calculating the value of a tree is to add up its environmental \"services,\" such as improving air quality, sequestering carbon, and saving energy in buildings by offering shade. But by this kind of pencil pusher calculation the resulting numbers are actually fairly low. In New York City, for example, a tree is valued at $400 for 80 years of service.\n\"They\'re very low-paid service workers,\" says Jeremijenko. \"And that isn\'t consistent with my sense of value. That doesn\'t sound right.\" When she created a similar temporary coworking \"tree office\" in New York a few years ago, 25 people each paid $40 membership fees, so the tree was suddenly generating $1,000 a month.\n\"That\'s a significant difference,\" she says. \"Positioning the tree as landlord is really to debate how do we constitute value.\"\nIn the project in New York, the profits were spent partly on augmenting the soil around the tree, and \"sending three saplings off to college\"—planting the tree\'s offshoots at NYU and Columbia. In a similar way, the project in London will directly benefit the host tree.\nJeremijenko sees the project as a translation of the Rights of Nature movement, which argues that ecosystems should have legal rights. The Bolivian ambassador plans to stop by the tree office to talk about his own country\'s historic law that gives nature equal rights as humans.\n\"The real work is making these connections,\" Jeremijenko says. \"How do we work together, and what kind of mutualistic relationships do we construct, in order to produce a desirable future?\"\n\"It\'s the grand challenge of the century—redesigning our relationship to natural systems,\" she says. \"The Tree Office is exploring that.\"\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 23

With increasing security requirements, it’s likely your word/number combinations are becoming even less memorable. But new research suggests it may not be long before you won’t need to memorize passwords.\n\n\n\"Brainprint,\" a  published in Neurocomputing, reveals that the brain’s reaction to certain words could be a unique identifying code—like a fingerprint—that could eventually replace passwords.\n\n\nIn a small experiment, the researchers hooked up an EEG to the scalps of 45 volunteers and measured their brains’ signals as they read through a list of 75 acronyms that included FBI and DVD. The word-recognition response differed so much between each participant that a second experiment using a computer program could identify each one with 94% accuracy.\n\n\nIt\'s not enough to feel totally secure, but promising enough to hint at the future of securing sensitive information. Especially given that monitoring brain activity as a means of verifying identity has been tested since 2007.\n\n\nThe advantage of using such a biometric system is that it can be used for continuous verification, New Scientist points out.\n\n\nPasswords or fingerprints only provide a tool for one-off identification. Continuous verification—by face or ear recognition, or perhaps by monitoring brain activity—could in theory allow someone to interact with many computer systems simultaneously, or even with a variety of intelligent objects, without having to repeatedly enter passwords for each device.\n\n\nAs Hollywood has illustrated, it’s simply a matter of cutting off a finger to appropriate that person’s identity. \"Brainprints, on the other hand, are potentially cancellable,\" said Sarah Laszlo, assistant professor of psychology and linguistics at Binghamton University and co-author of the study, \"So, in the unlikely event that attackers were actually able to steal a brainprint from an authorized user, the authorized user could then \'reset\' their brainprint.\"\n\n\nUntil now, brain signals have been a challenge to parse. This experiment leaped over the hurdle by focusing on the brainwaves from the specific area that reads and recognizes words. The signal is therefore clearer and easier to measure.\n\n\nThe drawback, so far, is that the brain signal is still not as accurate as scanning someone’s iris or fingerprint, and initially requires sticking diodes on your head in order to get a read. That’s ok, according to Zhanpeng Jin, assistant professor at Binghamton University and coauthor of the study, because brainprint isn’t going to be mass-produced any time soon. He says the researchers envision its use at places such as the Pentagon, where the number of authorized users is small, and they don’t need to be continuously verified the way you do to access your mobile device or email.\n\n\nBetter keep your memory sharp, at least a little while longer.\n\n\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 24

On Tuesday, the phones at Trashy Lingerie started to ring. Word had gotten out that the iconic Los Angeles store had designed the $200 \"Edy Corset\" that Jenner wore with such panache that she immediately inspired comparisons with classic Hollywood beauties like Rita Hayworth and Lauren Bacall.\n\n\nAccording to Mary Loomis-Shrier, the owner of Trashy Lingerie and its online site Trashy.com, one buyer placed an order for 500 of the very same corset, although she wasn’t sure exactly what he was planning to do with them. Trashy.com is now proudly featuring the corset on its homepage, in case any other big spenders decide they\'re in the market for the Edy Corset. Since the store makes all the costumes in-house, it is easy for them to accommodate this sudden spike in demand.\n\n\nWhile Loomis-Shrier is thrilled about the Vanity Fair cover and the new wave of interest in her company, this isn’t a new experience for her.\n\n\nFor nearly four decades, Trashy Lingerie has been Hollywood’s sexy outfitter of choice. Remember the bunny outfit Reese Witherspoon wore in Legally Blonde? Or the one that Renée Zellweger wore in Bridget Jones’s Diary? Those were from Trashy. Emma Stone’s black corset emblazoned with a scarlet letter in Easy A? Yup: Trashy. In fact, a slew of celebs—from Madonna to Dolly—have slipped into the brand\'s frisky looks, as their Instagram feed reveals. And Trashy is responsible for keeping many of the Playboy playmates clothed (if only barely so). Loomis-Shrier tells us that O.J. Simpson\'s prosecutor, Marcia Clark, bought a sexy dominatrix outfit from Trashy to wear under her trial outfit to feel empowered during the proceedings in 1994 and 1995. (We\'ve tried to contact Clark to confirm this, and have not yet heard back. We\'ll update the story if we do.)\n\n\nA-list celebrities often stop at Trashy to be fitted for Halloween costumes and fancy dress outfits. Jenner’s stepdaughter, Kim Kardashian, is a regular at the store, says Loomis-Shrier. Every year, according to Loomis-Shrier, Kardashian buys 10 separate costumes for Halloween so that she has a different look for each of the parties that she is invited to attend. On any given October over the last decade, you may have seen Kardashian strutting her stuff as a mermaid, a cat, or Wonder Woman; these were all costumes created by Trashy Lingerie designers. \"We’ve been doing all the Kardashians\' costumes forever,\" Loomis-Shrier tells Fast Company. \"Kim has an unusual body with her booty and her boobs, and we can accommodate that.\"\n\n\nIt isn’t clear whether Jenner herself or Vanity Fair’s fashion and style director, Jessica Diehl, was responsible for picking Trashy’s corset for the photo shoot; we reached out to Diehl, but she said she was too overwhelmed with press requests to speak with us, and Jenner’s PR team did not respond to interview requests.\n\n\nLoomis-Shrier says that Vanity Fair has used Trashy outfits over the years, but given how closely she has worked with the Kardashian family in the past, she wouldn’t be surprised if Jenner suggested looking at Trashy designs to create the right look for the cover.\n\n\nJenner didn’t actually come into the store for a fitting. Instead, an unassuming stylist arrived, requesting three different corsets made to particular measurements. \"We had no idea who it was for,\" Loomis-Shrier says. \"We had no idea that it would land on the cover of Vanity Fair. That was really just stupid luck for us.\"\n\n\nBut, in some ways, this is just par for the course for Trashy. Given how many high-profile clients the company serves, stylists and personal assistants often visit the store to select outfits on behalf of a celebrity, so the Trashy team often has no idea when their outfits will be splashed on the pages of a magazine. Trashy designs show up in the media on a monthly basis, with stars and models wearing them in Elle, Rolling Stone, Harper’s Bazaar, Nylon, and of course, Playboy, among many other publications.\n\n\nSometimes, celebrities want to deliberately distance themselves from Trashy simply because they don\'t want to be associated with the store\'s name. But the name of the store wasn\'t really meant to be all that scandalous. Trashy actually began as a shoe store in 1973 by Mitchell and Tracy Shrier, who named it after one of their most popular shoe designs. Customers wanted to wear stockings with these sexy shoes, so the Shriers started to hand-dye hosiery to match the shoes and then eventually made matching garters.\n\n\nBefore they knew it, they had a full-blown lingerie business on their hands. Mary Loomis-Shrier eventually married the Shriers\'s son, Randy, and got involved with the family business. It was her idea to launch the company’s website in 1998, which ended up driving more sales than the brick-and-mortar store. (Trashy has no immediate plans to change the store’s name, even if it makes some celebrities cringe.)\n\n\nLoomis-Shrier thinks that celebrities and movie designers have used Trashy as a resource because the store is able to customize any design and transform it from a sketch into an outfit in a matter of days.\n\n\nThe company employs a team of 35 sewers and designers who are highly skilled at tailoring barely-there lingerie designs to suit the customer’s body type. \"We design and manufacture everything ourselves, and you can custom-make anything to suit your body,\" Loomis-Shrier says. \"We offer that to all of our customers at no additional expense, and people really like that.\"\n\n\nTrashy costume designs average between $200 and $300, which makes it less expensive than a competitor like Agent Provocateur, whose playsuits can cost several thousands of dollars. Of course, Trashy customers can also request more elaborate costumes that might run as high as $900.\n\n\nLoomis-Shrier is hoping to give the store and the website a major revamp over the next year. Currently, the brick-and-mortar store in Los Angeles is a giant concrete building that is painted cotton-candy pink with a sign that features a retro picture of a girl in a garter and boots holding an umbrella.\n\n\nInside, the store feels like a warehouse, with some designs that have been on the floor since the store opened. Visiting the store is an experience in itself: It requires customers to have a membership to enter, and even then, they need to pay $2 to be in the building. \"We do this to have the legal right to kick people out,\" Loomis-Shrier explains. \"Otherwise, there would be these weirdos who want to drool on everybody.\"\n\n\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 25

Protecting the enterprise perimeter from outside threats is no longer a viable security defense.\"\n\n\nTerbium’s model is centered around \"digital fingerprinting\" of sensitive information by customers; Terbium does not receive access to any sensitive files.

But the documents also note that the N.S.A. sought to target hackers even when it could not establish any links to foreign powers.\nThe disclosures, based on documents provided by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, and shared with The New York Times and ProPublica, come at a time of unprecedented cyberattacks on American financial institutions, businesses and government agencies, but also of greater scrutiny of secret legal justifications for broader government surveillance.\nWhile the Senate passed legislation this week limiting some of the N.S.A.’s authority, it involved provisions in the U.S.A. Patriot Act and did not apply to the warrantless wiretapping program.\nGovernment officials defended the N.S.A.’s monitoring of suspected hackers as necessary to shield Americans from the increasingly aggressive activities of foreign governments. But critics say it raises difficult trade-offs that should be subject to public debate.\nThe N.S.A.’s activities run “smack into law enforcement land,” said Jonathan Mayer, a cybersecurity scholar at Stanford Law School who has researched privacy issues and who reviewed several of the documents. “That’s a major policy decision about how to structure cybersecurity in the U.S. and not a conversation that has been had in public.”\nIt is not clear what standards the agency is using to select targets. It can be hard to know for sure who is behind a particular intrusion — a foreign government or a criminal gang — and the N.S.A. is supposed to focus on foreign intelligence, not law enforcement.\nThe government can also gather significant volumes of Americans’ information — anything from private emails to trade secrets and business dealings — through Internet surveillance because monitoring the data flowing to a hacker involves copying that information as the hacker steals it.\nOne internal N.S.A. document notes that agency surveillance activities through “hacker signatures pull in a lot.”\nBrian Hale, the spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said, “It should come as no surprise that the U.S. government gathers intelligence on foreign powers that attempt to penetrate U.S. networks and steal the private information of U.S. citizens and companies.” He added that “targeting overseas individuals engaging in hostile cyberactivities on behalf of a foreign power is a lawful foreign intelligence purpose.”\nThe effort is the latest known expansion of the N.S.A.’s warrantless surveillance program, which allows the government to intercept Americans’ cross-border communications if the target is a foreigner abroad. While the N.S.A. has long searched for specific email addresses and phone numbers of foreign intelligence targets, the Obama administration three years ago started allowing the agency to search its communications streams for less-identifying Internet protocol addresses or strings of harmful computer code.\nThe surveillance activity traces to changes that began after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The government tore down a so-called wall that prevented intelligence and criminal investigators from sharing information about suspected spies and terrorists. The barrier had been erected to protect Americans’ rights because intelligence investigations use lower legal standards than criminal inquiries, but policy makers decided it was too much of an obstacle to terrorism investigations.\nThe N.S.A. also started the warrantless wiretapping program, which caused an outcry when it was disclosed in 2005. In 2008, under the FISA Amendments Act, Congress legalized the surveillance program so long as the agency targeted only noncitizens abroad. A year later, the new Obama administration began crafting a new cybersecurity policy — including weighing whether the Internet had made the distinction between a spy and a criminal obsolete.\n“Reliance on legal authorities that make theoretical distinctions between armed attacks, terrorism and criminal activity may prove impractical,” the White House National Security Council wrote in a classified annex to a policy report in May 2009, which was included in the N.S.A.’s internal files.\nAbout that time, the documents show, the N.S.A. — whose mission includes protecting military and intelligence networks against intruders — proposed using the warrantless surveillance program for cybersecurity purposes. The agency received “guidance on targeting using the signatures” from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, according to an internal newsletter.\nIn May and July 2012, according to an internal timeline, the Justice Department granted its secret approval for the searches of cybersignatures and Internet addresses. The Justice Department tied that authority to a pre-existing approval by the secret surveillance court permitting the government to use the program to monitor foreign governments.\nThat limit meant the N.S.A. had to have some evidence for believing that the hackers were working for a specific foreign power. That rule, the N.S.A. soon complained, left a “huge collection gap against cyberthreats to the nation” because it is often hard to know exactly who is behind an intrusion, according to an agency newsletter. Different computer intruders can use the same piece of malware, take steps to hide their location or pretend to be someone else.\nSo the N.S.A., in 2012, began pressing to go back to the surveillance court and seek permission to use the program explicitly for cybersecurity purposes. That way, it could monitor international communications for any “malicious cyberactivity,” even if it did not yet know who was behind the attack.\nThe newsletter described the further expansion as one of “highest priorities” of the N.S.A. director, Gen. Keith B. Alexander. However, a former senior intelligence official said that the government never asked the court to grant that authority.\nMeanwhile, the F.B.I. in 2011 had obtained a new kind of wiretap order from the secret surveillance court for cybersecurity investigations, permitting it to target Internet data flowing to or from specific Internet addresses linked to certain governments.\nTo carry out the orders, the F.B.I. negotiated in 2012 to use the N.S.A.’s system for monitoring Internet traffic crossing “chokepoints operated by U.S. providers through which international communications enter and leave the United States,” according to a 2012 N.S.A. document. The N.S.A. would send the intercepted traffic to the bureau’s “cyberdata repository” in Quantico, Virginia.\nThe disclosure that the N.S.A. and the F.B.I. have expanded their cybersurveillance adds a dimension to a recurring debate over the post-Sept. 11 expansion of government spying powers: Information about Americans sometimes gets swept up incidentally when foreigners are targeted, and prosecutors can use that information in criminal cases.\nCiting the potential for a copy of data “exfiltrated” by a hacker to contain “so much” information about Americans, one N.S.A. lawyer suggested keeping the stolen data out of the agency’s regular repository for information collected by surveillance so that analysts working on unrelated issues could not query it, a 2010 training document showed. But it is not clear whether the agency or the F.B.I. has imposed any additional limits on the data of hacking victims.\nIn a response to questions for this article, the F.B.I. pointed to its existing procedures for protecting victims’ data acquired during investigations, but also said it continually reviewed its policies “to adapt to these changing threats while protecting civil liberties and the interests of victims of cybercrimes.”\nNone of these actions or proposals had been disclosed to the public. As recently as February, when President Obama spoke about cybersecurity at an event at Stanford University, he lauded the importance of transparency but did not mention this change.\n“The technology so often outstrips whatever rules and structures and standards have been put in place, which means that government has to be constantly self-critical and we have to be able to have an open debate about it,” Mr. Obama said.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 29

At 9:05 p.m. Monday, they spoke by cellphone with relatives back home in Shanghai, and everything seemed fine. Nothing was said about the weather or the rain showers in the area.\nBut less than 25 minutes later, a violent storm capsized the ship. Of the 456 passengers, only 14 are believed to have survived, including the captain. One of the survivors said he swam until dawn.\nOn Thursday, three days after the accident, the victims’ grieving families were still searching for answers about what happened that evening; why the captain was one of the few survivors; and more grimly, when the bodies of their loved ones would be recovered from the wreckage.\nThe confirmed death toll increased to 77 on Thursday, according to China Central Television, and about 1,200 family members have arrived in Jianli County, where the accident occurred, officials said.\nIn all, 442 people are presumed dead, including Mr. Yang, Ms. Chen and their granddaughter, one of the youngest passengers on a ship that was filled mostly with retirees in their 60s and 70s. It is one of the worst maritime accidents in Asia in decades.\n“Yesterday was children’s day, and today, I have no idea whether my child is alive or not,” Tang Xia, the girl’s mother, said, sobbing Tuesday afternoon at a local government bureau where parents had gathered hoping for word about their loved ones. “I’m waiting desperately for any updates, or any official who can talk with me.”\nMany families are still hoping that, by some miracle, someone will be found alive.\nThe government has not released an official passenger list of those aboard the Oriental Star, nor has the cruise ship operator, the Chongqing Oriental Ferry Company, although various websites have published what purport to be passenger lists.\nFamilies have expressed anger and frustration at the slow response from the government, the ship operator and the travel agencies involved, with some of them saying they have not been formally contacted or informed about the investigation.\nIn a sign of the high-level attention being focused on the disaster, President Xi Jinping held a meeting on Thursday of the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest echelon of political power in China, to discuss the rescue efforts. It found them satisfactory.\n“In handling the response to this emergency, related aspects reacted with urgency, provided orderly assistance and took efficient steps,” the committee said, according to a summary from the official Xinhua news agency.\nThe Chinese leadership ordered a detailed investigation into the cause of the ship’s sinking that “didn’t let any doubtful point slip by,” Xinhua said.\nIt also directed how grieving family members should be approached.\n“It is extremely important to help family members deal with the aftermath,” the committee said, adding that officials should “empathize with family members’ suffering, do a good job of placating them and conscientiously maintain social stability,” according to Xinhua.\nMany grieving families have traveled to Hubei Province in central China to watch the rescue operation or to wait for the bodies to be recovered. Others have organized support groups online and started sharing photographs of friends and family members, as well as pictures of the journey that passengers had posted online before the accident.\nWhen tragedies occur in China, families often direct their anger at the government. When news of the disaster spread on Tuesday, families in Shanghai descended upon one of the travel agencies for answers. After the police directed them to a local government petition bureau, they cried, pleaded for answers and lashed out at local officials. One group tore down a government barricade.\n“We have a right to tell our story,” said a woman named Wang, after government officers asked her to stop giving interviews on Tuesday. “This is our freedom. We’ve lost our relatives.”\nIn Jianli County in Hubei Province, where the ship capsized, the authorities have begun lining up special coffins, decorated with flowers, in anticipation of the huge numbers of bodies that are expected to be found in the days ahead. The authorities are aware of the potential for excruciatingly grim scenes because many of the bodies may have decomposed and been disfigured by being underwater for days.\nMore than 1,100 responders and 100 boats were participating in rescue efforts, the Jianli County chief, Huang Zhen, told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. Local residents and hotels are providing free accommodations, and government employees are providing support for relatives of ship passengers, Mr. Huang said.\nRescue workers have begun to cut holes in the hull of the ship, which is floating bottom side up, hoping to find survivors. Officials have also discussed lifting the entire boat out of the river.\nThe Transport Ministry said an operation to right the capsized ship was to begin Thursday night, Xinhua reported.\nMany of the passengers on the Oriental Star had come from Shanghai, where they had booked the trip through a tourist agency. Chen Guiyu said three of her four sisters and two brothers-in-law had joined a large tour group for the cruise, which was to last about 10 days.\nHer eldest sister, Chengying, had just celebrated her 70th birthday, and they seemed pleased with the ship’s accommodations. They even sent back photographs, which they posted on the social networking site WeChat, showing them posing at various sites and even washing clothes along the river during one of the stops.\nIn a telephone interview on Thursday, Ms. Chen said she and other family members had boarded a train bound for Hubei Province. She said that her five family members had been confirmed dead. The last time she heard from the family was 7:53 p.m. Monday, when one of her sisters, Guiying, posted a group of photos online.\n“I never heard there were any concerns about the weather,” Ms. Chen said. “All they told us was how luxurious the ship was, and how happy they were. My sister and I replied to them via WeChat, and said, ‘Enjoy yourself in this rare get-together.’ ”\nLess than two hours later, in stormy weather, they most likely perished after the Oriental Star made a sharp change of direction and then capsized in water 50 feet deep.\nIn Shanghai, Chen Lindi and her family were preparing to travel to Hubei Province to identify her relatives’ bodies. The government had bought six high-speed rail tickets for Ms. Chen to go and identify the bodies of her relatives — her sister and brother-in-law, Chen Cailian and Mr. Yang, and their granddaughter, Chenlin — once they are recovered.\nChenlin loved Hello Kitty, so her mother is carrying a Hello Kitty hair clip and a princess dress. The parents are holding out hope that Chenlin and her grandparents might have survived.\n“She was going to perform an Indian dance, and play the guzheng,” a traditional Chinese string instrument, her aunt, Chen Lindi, said by telephone on Thursday. “She had rehearsed for the Indian dance before leaving.”\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 30

Everything has been burnt down,” said Mr. Vanderpuije, who added that he had visited the scene Thursday morning with Ghana’s president, John Dramani Mahama. “All the vehicles in the filling station have been burned. We saw bodies there. It’s a major disaster.”\nOne witness said that a bus packed with passengers parked at the station had caught fire and all on board had died.\nFrancis Boateng, a Red Cross official in Accra, said that the rain began three days ago and that water had flooded the gas station’s fuel storage. “The fire was on the water,” he said. “There are so many people who were consumed by the fire.”\nMr. Boateng put the death toll at around 90 and said the search for bodies was continuing in the high waters.\nGhanaian news outlets reported that the flooding had impeded rescue workers, and that ambulances had been late to arrive at the scene. Early Thursday morning, two vans packed with charred bodies left for the morgue, but a military hospital reported that the morgue was at capacity and could not take any more of the dead.\nTouring the disaster scene, Mr. Mahama said, “The loss of lives is catastrophic and almost unprecedented.”\nHe was critical of the disorderly approach to construction in the capital, which exacerbates flooding during periods of heavy rain.\n“We should not continue to be like the vulture who says he would roof his house when the rain comes,” Mr. Mahama said.\nFlooding has battered the already shaky power infrastructure in the capital, where the electricity deficit has brought thousands of demonstrators into the streets this year and hurt the country’s economy.\nGhana’s currency has dropped precipitously against the dollar over the past year, and the country was forced to seek a three-year loan of more than $900 million from the International Monetary Fund, even as the fund was critical of the government’s undisciplined public spending.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 31

And if anyone else knows, I do,” Mr. Warner said in his home country of Trinidad and Tobago on Wednesday, referring to Mr. Blatter’s decision this week to resign after 17 years at the helm of FIFA, soccer’s governing body. Mr. Warner, who said he feared for his own life, also said he had evidence linking FIFA to his country’s 2010 election.\nMr. Warner was once a close ally of Chuck Blazer, the former general secretary of Concacaf, the governing body that oversees soccer in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. Mr. Blazer has admitted taking bribes from bidders seeking to host the 1998 and 2010 World Cups and is now cooperating with the American authorities. On Wednesday, a judge in New York ordered the release of a redacted version of his plea hearing in 2013.\nMr. Warner’s sons, Daryan and Daryll, are also cooperating with the authorities, having secretly pleaded guilty in 2013 after they tried to deposit more than $600,000 in nearly two dozen United States bank accounts in an attempt to avoid detection.\nDuring a rambling and sometimes incoherent seven-minute television address, called “The Gloves Are Off,” Mr. Warner invoked Gandhi and sought to cast himself as a victim. In his speech, a paid political advertisement, he said he had reams of documents, including copies of checks, linking Mr. Blatter and other senior FIFA officials to an effort to manipulate a 2010 election in Trinidad and Tobago.\nHe said he had delivered his files to “respectable persons” and lawyers, and he warned that he had an “avalanche” of additional evidence.\n“I will no longer keep secrets for them who now seek to destroy the country which I love,” he said.\nMr. Warner’s television address came just four days after he vigorously defended himself in an online video, saying the charges against him were a conspiracy cooked up by the United States.\n“All this has stemmed from the failed U.S. bid to host the World Cup,” he said of the indictment then.\n“I could understand the U.S. embarrassment,” Mr. Warner continued, but it is important to “take your losses like a man.”\nIn the video, posted Sunday on his personal website, Facebook page and YouTube channel, he cited an article from The Onion that he said backed up his claims, apparently unaware that it was satire. He also told his supporters that he was innocent of the charges against him. “At the end of the day, all of the allegations against me shall be proven to be unfounded,” he said.\nIt was not clear why FIFA would want to intervene in the country’s electoral process, and Mr. Warner did not immediately provide any evidence in the television address on Wednesday to support his claims.\n“I apologize for not disclosing my knowledge of these events before,” Mr. Warner said, calling himself a “lone isolated soldier.” He said conditions in the jail where he was held briefly after his arrest last week had been “woeful.”\nHe said nothing would prevent him from revealing details of the scandal. “Not even death will stop the avalanche that is coming,” he told his supporters. “The die is cast. There can be no turning back. Let the chips fall where they fall.” Paraphrasing Gandhi, he said that throughout history, tyrants have fallen in the end.\nMr. Warner also said he felt threatened, saying, “I reasonably actually fear for my life.” Yet shortly after the speech was broadcast, he appeared at a rally for his Independent Liberal Party, and seemed resolute.\nMr. Warner faces a raft of charges, including racketeering, bribery, wire fraud and money laundering, but he denies the accusations. In 2004, as FIFA’s executive committee was deliberating where to hold the 2010 World Cup, South Africa’s government arranged for what amounted to a $10 million bribe to Mr. Warner and others in exchange for their votes, prosecutors say.\nAccording to the indictment, which was handed down May 20 but announced last week, when FIFA was considering which country would host the 2006 World Cup, Mr. Warner sent a relative to a Paris hotel room to collect a briefcase filled with $10,000 in cash from a South African bid committee official.\nSouth Africa has emphatically denied giving any bribes to ensure that it would host the tournament, but news reports on Thursday said the country’s organized-crime unit had opened a preliminary investigation into the bribery accusations.\nThe Australian police are also investigating corruption accusations in connection to the country’s bid for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, amid allegations that funds were misappropriated. The chairman of Football Federation Australia, Frank Lowy, published an open letter on Wednesday in which he cited an investigation by Concacaf showing that Mr. Warner had committed fraud and misappropriated the funds.\nAustralian officials in recent days have been expressing their deep disappointment at losing the World Cup to Qatar, and some critics of the Qatari bid are hoping that it will lose the tournament, even as officials there insist that their bid was above reproach and that the tournament is not under threat. The sports minister of the Australian state of Victoria, John Eren, said his country could host the World Cup “tomorrow.”\nElsewhere, the former England soccer captain David Beckham added his voice to those in European soccer who have grown weary of Mr. Blatter. “I hope at last we are now moving in the right direction,” he was quoted as saying by the BBC. “Some of the things that we now know happened were despicable, unacceptable and awful for the game we love so much.”\nMr. Beckham, who rose to global stardom playing for Manchester United, was a central supporter of England’s unsuccessful bid to host the World Cup in 2018, which was awarded to Russia.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 32

The scandal has now emboldened and invigorated pro-Moscow forces in the tug of war over former Soviet lands.\nIurie Leanca, Moldova’s prime minister until early this year, said he knew his country’s lenders “were going in the wrong direction” because of huge “toxic loans” to insiders. But little could be done, he said, “because institutions simply do not work here.”\n“Only when you become prime minister do you realize how rotten the whole system is,” he added.\nThe events first came dimly to light in November, when Moldova’s central bank took control of Banca de Economii, one of the country’s biggest lenders, and then two other troubled institutions, Banca Sociala and Unibank.\nThen, in May, Andrian Candu, a powerful politician, used his personal blog to leak a confidential report commissioned by the central bank and conducted by the investigations company Kroll.\nThe report named Ilan Shor, a 28-year-old Moldovan oligarch who bought into ownership of Banca de Economii in 2013, as the protagonist in “a coordinated effort involving all three banks working together to extract as much loan finance as possible from the banks without any obvious business rationale.”\nLoans at one bank were paid off with loans from another bank and were then followed by yet more borrowing, the report revealed.\n“It was like a carousel,” said Mr. Candu, who is the speaker of the Moldovan Parliament and a close political ally and personal friend of Moldova’s richest oligarch, Vladimir Plahotniuc.\nFrom September 2010 to November 2014, the report said, companies linked to Mr. Shor increased their borrowing from banks a hundredfold to the equivalent of nearly $750 million at current exchange rates. Factoring in interest, Mr. Shor’s group now owes around $1 billion. It shows no sign of returning this.\nMr. Shor, now under house arrest at his sprawling residential compound in Chisinau, the capital, declined to be interviewed for this article. But, in an emailed response to written questions, he denied allegations that he had orchestrated a swindle, saying there was “no documentary evidence” to support Kroll’s conclusions of deliberate looting.\nThe reason for that is perhaps the fate of the Volkswagen van, reduced to a charred wreck by a mysterious fire and now held in a police lot here in Ialoveni, a small town southwest of Chisinau. The van, owned by the security company Klassica Force, was carrying 12 sacks of loan documents from Banca de Economii when it was reported stolen and caught fire “under suspicious circumstances,” according to the Kroll report.\nOther than Mr. Shor, nobody seems to believe the van was stolen and burned by thieves, despite a police report to that effect.\nMr. Candu dismissed the stolen van report as a “primitive scheme” to hide the traces of an elaborate theft that shifted hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore accounts.\n“It was a stupid mistake,” he said. “You can’t just burn a car and think everything disappears. Money leaves a trace.”\nMr. Shor scoffed at the idea of a cover-up, saying that only “illiterate persons” would try to conceal their tracks by burning documents that have digital and other copies. “It makes no sense to burn any of them, even if this could come into somebody’s mind,” he said.\nThe Klassica Force van, he said, was the object of a straightforward “cash-in-transit vehicle theft.”\nDorin Dragutanu, the governor of Moldova’s central bank, said he believed the theft and the fire had been staged. But the real purpose, he said, was to hide the likelihood that Banca de Economii had no real documents to account for its lending.\n“If you have transactions that are fake and don’t have any paperwork, you need to show somehow that the documents disappeared,” he said.\nThe scandal has been a political gift for the zealously pro-Russian Socialist Party, the largest group in Parliament after elections late last year, just days after news of the banking crisis first broke. Bolstered by the public reaction to details that surfaced in May, the party is expected to do well in local elections this month.\nIgor Dodon, the leader of the Socialists, said the disappearance of so much money showed how the European Union had backed the wrong horse by supporting Moldova’s pro-European forces, which had held power since 2009. “The more money Europe gives, the more money our oligarchs steal,” he said.\nPro-European politicians say the roots of the scandal came from an earlier period of left-wing rule. Mr. Candu, the parliamentary speaker and a champion of closer links with the West, said Banca de Economii had been known for more than a decade “as a milk cow” for previous Communist-led governments.\n“It was always a place for fraud,” he said.\nWhen Mr. Shor married a Russian pop star in 2011, Mr. Dodon and two previous Moldovan presidents, both from the Communist Party, attended a lavish reception in Chisinau, along with many other prominent politicians and business figures.\nToday, former associates are distancing themselves from Mr. Shor, who is also running in elections this month, a candidacy that shields him from prosecution, despite his house arrest. Police officers armed with automatic weapons guard his vast residence around the clock, as do Mr. Shor’s own security guards, hired from Klassica Force, the same company whose van carrying bank files was supposedly stolen and then set on fire.\nBorn in Israel into a Jewish family from Moldova that, according to Moldova’s anticorruption agency chief, had close ties to that country’s governing elite during Soviet rule, Mr. Shor was taken to Moldova as a child. Building on his father’s connections and business interests, he became one of Chisinau’s richest men, with stakes in banking, duty-free shops, a soccer team, insurance and other ventures.\nMr. Shor, in his written responses to questions, acknowledged that Banca de Economii had serious problems with “unfavorable” loans, but he said that those dated from the previous management and had been kept secret from him until after he bought into the bank’s ownership in 2013.\nHe said he had kept quiet about this “bomb” because going public at the time would have led to the “inevitable crash of the whole banking system.” All his moves since, he added, were simply “remedial actions” intended to save the bank.\nPrime Minister Chiril Gaburici, voicing a widespread view, said that he did not believe Mr. Shor was solely responsible for the missing money and that he must have had powerful accomplices. “I don’t think Mr. Shor could do this alone,” Mr. Gaburici said.\nPeople in government were probably involved, either directly, for personal gain or simply through inattention to what was going on, investigators here believe. But the question that most concerns the country is the one raised on national television by a journalist, Natalia Morari, who appeared on her evening show, “Politica,” wearing a T-shirt with the words, “Where’s the billion?”\nThat is unclear. The money lent by Banca de Economii and the other banks sloshed in and out of various foreign accounts, often held in Latvia, according to the Kroll report.\nAs the carousel of lending from bank to bank began to spin out of control, companies controlled by Mr. Shor transferred a total of $232.2 million, as well as 544.5 million euros, or almost $600 million, to mysterious offshore entities in just two days, Nov. 25 and 26, according to the Kroll report.\nShortly before this, Banca de Economii’s loan portfolio was abruptly moved, through a series of opaque transactions, to Banca Sociala. That bank then announced it had held a shareholders’ meeting in a remote Ukrainian town on Nov. 26 and decided to transfer collection rights on the loans to a British-registered company called Fortuna.\nThe next day, the van carrying bank documents was burned. Mr. Dragutanu, the central bank governor, said the shareholders’ meeting in Ukraine and the deal with Fortuna were “completely fake,” noting that Fortuna had supposedly agreed to pay full price for the loan portfolio, but not until 2019.\nAsked about the looting of Moldova’s banks at a news conference in Chisinau, the European Union’s ambassador to Moldava, Pirkka Tapiola, voiced the dismay that has gripped locals and foreign diplomats. “I do not have an answer for you on how it is possible to steal so much money from a small country,” he said.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 33

He was not present at the court.\nThe ruling was seen as a triumph of sorts for opponents of Mubarak who perceive his treatment by the courts as too lenient.\n\"I was sure of this ruling because there were many violations by the criminal court (which dropped the case). It confirms that the January revolution is claiming back its right,\" said Yasser Sayed Ahmed, a lawyer for victims of the violence during the uprising.\nLawyers told Reuters the court on Thursday upheld other cases that cleared Mubarak and his sons of graft charges. It also upheld a previous ruling that cleared Mubarak\'s former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, and six aides. The defendants had denied the charges.\nBut for some of Mubarak\'s opponents, the ruling did not go far enough.\n\"Today\'s ruling was issued with a final acquittal for Mubarak\'s regime over the killing of protesters under the leadership of Adly. Mubarak\'s retrial is just a red herring,\" Shadi El Ghazaly Harb, a prominent anti-Mubarak activist, said on his Facebook account.\nHundreds of people died when security forces clashed with protesters in the weeks before Mubarak was forced from power.\nMany Egyptians who lived through Mubarak\'s rule view it as a period of autocracy and crony capitalism. His overthrow led to Egypt\'s first free election, which brought in Islamist President Mohamed Mursi.\nBut Mursi only lasted a year in office after mass protests against his rule in 2013 prompted an overthrow by then army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who later went on to win a presidential election last year.\nSisi has since launched a crackdown on Mursi and his Muslim Brotherhood. Authorities have jailed thousands of Brotherhood supporters. Mursi himself may be facing a death sentence after a court sought to impose it on him.\nBy contrast, Mubarak-era figures are slowly being cleared of charges and a series of laws limiting political freedoms have raised fears that the old leadership is regaining influence.\nTEARS, SHOUTS IN COURT\nSupporters of Mubarak first erupted in applause because they thought he would not face another retrial but many later dissolved in tears and yelled at the judge\'s ruling.\n\"Egypt will never see stability as long as Mubarak is treated unfairly,\" said Aseela Abdelmoty.\nMubarak, who ruled Egypt with an iron first, has already spent at least three years in prison for other cases.\nLast month an Egyptian court sentenced the former ruler and his two sons to three years in jail without parole in the retrial of a corruption case.\nThe U.S.-backed Egyptian government says it is committed to democracy, and large-scale unrest in the Arab world\'s most populous country has ended.\nBut Sinai-based Islamist militants have launched an insurgency after Mursi was ousted and have killed hundreds of police and soldiers. Two tourism police were killed on Wednesday on a road near the Giza Pyramids.\nThe government does not make a distinction between such groups and the Brotherhood, which has been banned as a terrorist organization. The Brotherhood denies any link to recent violence and maintains it remains committed to peaceful activism.\nOn Thursday, a court in the southern province of Sohag sentenced 51 suspected Brotherhood supporters to between three and 10 years in jail over the killing of four people, including a police officer at a protest in 2014, judicial sources said. Three others were acquitted.\n(Additional reporting by Omar Fahmy,; Writing by Yara Bayoumy; Editing by Angus MacSwan)\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 34

He was still a juvenile. He wasn’t an adult,” he added. “This was not rape or anything like that. This was touching someone over their clothes.”\nMr. and Mrs. Duggar said they sent Josh to counseling and had him talk to the police.\nThe interview on Fox News, which was pretaped at the Duggars’ home in Arkansas, came roughly two weeks after TLC said it was withdrawing the Duggars’ reality show, “19 Kids and Counting,” from its lineup. The show follows the Duggar family — Mr. and Mrs. Duggar and their 19 children — who are conservative Christians.\nThat decision followed a report in In Touch magazine that Josh, now 27, had been investigated for molesting underage girls. Since TLC withdrew the show, at least 20 companies have distanced themselves from the program. Many have taken their ads off the show or are taking steps to do so.\nThe Duggar parents, teary-eyed and looking to each other for support, defended their decision to start the reality show despite their son’s conduct, saying they saw no reason for concern.\n“When they asked us to do that reality TV show, all of this had been taken care of five years before, and we had a clean bill of health from the state,” Mr. Duggar said.\nAsked what would happen to the Duggars, given the backlash, Mr. Duggar replied, “I don’t know if the rest of our family should be punished for the act of one of our children.”\n“We are fine whether they film us or not,” he added.\nMr. Duggar did not say whether TLC had indicated that the show would be canceled.\nMs. Kelly also spoke to two of the sisters, Jessa Seewald and Jill Dillard. That interview will air on Friday.\nIn a clip from Fox News, Ms. Seewald said in the interview that she was one of the victims and that what Josh did was “very wrong.”\n“I do want to speak up in his defense against people who are calling him a child molester or a pedophile or a rapist,” she said.\n“I’m like, that is so overboard and a lie, really,” she added. “I mean people get mad at me for saying that, but I can say this because I was one of the victims.”\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 35

They dazzled Chinese hungry for change, and the concept of civil society took off. Within months, it seemed as if everyone was setting up an NGO.\nAs the state sought to control the phenomenon, the Gongo, or government-organized NGO, was born. Yet as China’s economy grew and society grew in complexity along with it, NGOs multiplied. Often they were unregistered or registered as businesses because of the financial and legal difficulties of operating independently of the state. Two decades later, there are many thousands of NGOs in China.\nLast Friday, the Communist Party announced that a Politburo meeting headed by President Xi Jinping had decided that party groups should be set up in social, cultural and economic organizations, thus potentially creating a host of Pongos, or party-organized NGOs. The announcement has stirred unease among some. \n‘‘Did you see the Politburo order?’’ an editor at a party newspaper asked, sotto voce, at a reception. ‘‘They’re going to set up party groups in all NGOs.’’\nI asked whether this would apply to foreign NGOs. Would the Gates Foundation soon have a party cell in its midst?\n‘‘They don’t need to do that,’’ he said. ‘‘The foreign NGO law will control the foreign NGOs. This will control the domestic NGOs.’’\nHe was referring to a draft law aimed at managing more closely the activities of overseas NGOs in China and their Chinese partners and limiting foreign funding for Chinese NGOs. It has been widely criticized by domestic and overseas rights advocates as repressive.\nWas Mr. Xi’s government taking another step away from authoritarianism toward a new kind of totalitarianism by spreading the party and its ideology into more and more areas, pushing out the gains by civil society since 1995, as some Chinese critics are whispering? Mr. Xi may be popular with the masses, but his emphasis on party growing and Maoist-style values has made some intellectuals, even businesspeople, uneasy.\nChinese are divided as to what the Politburo directive shows. To Zhang Zhiru, the head of the Shenzhen Chunfeng Labor Dispute Services Center, a small NGO, it shows the party is in trouble.\n‘‘Local cadres see that the party has lost control in all kinds of areas. That’s why this directive was issued,’’ Mr. Zhang wrote in a social media message.\nThe decay of its moral authority after decades of corruption and abuse of power is so advanced that this new push will not penetrate the grass roots where most NGOs are located, he predicted.\nTo Zhang Weiwei, a professor at Fudan University and a leading proponent of the authoritarian ‘‘China model’’ of political and economic development, the directive shows the party is flourishing.\n‘‘After Xi Jinping came to power, I’d say the biggest development is that the party is marching to the forefront,’’ he said. ‘‘This is the new normal.’’\nOn an organizational level, it is unclear how party groups would be inserted into small NGOs, said Shawn Shieh, a Hong Kong-based civil society specialist. A party cell usually consists of three people, he said. Some NGOs may number no more than half a dozen. ‘‘How are they going to fit three people into a small NGO?’’ he asked.\nStill, he said, ‘‘Over the last few years, local government and party organizations have clearly become more proactive about engaging with NGOs, so we may well see more progress in establishing party groups.’’\nThe directive did not appear to apply just to NGOs, but to all kinds of ‘‘mass,’’ or nonparty, organizations, an aspect of Mr. Xi’s program that has led some intellectuals to whisper of a creeping totalitarianism.\n‘‘Given that party strengthening and discipline is something that Xi Jinping has made a major theme of his administration, we can’t dismiss it as run of the mill,’’ Mr. Shieh said of the directive.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 36

That has allowed it to present itself as the sole guardian of Sunni interests in a vast territory cutting across Iraq and Syria.\nIdeologically unified, the Islamic State is emerging as a social and political movement in many Sunni areas, filling a void in the absence of solid national identity and security. At the same time, it responds brutally to any other Sunni group, militant or civilian, that poses a challenge to its supremacy.\nThat dual strategy, purporting to represent Sunni interests and attacking any group that vies to play the same role, has allowed it to grow in the face of withering airstrikes.\nWhile the Obama administration has focused on confronting the Islamic State militarily, experts say the group’s recent victories point to the need for a political component in the strategy to counter the group — even after nearly 4,000 airstrikes by the American-led coalition and what United States officials say are the deaths of 10,000 ISIS militants.\n“They are hijacking legitimate demands,” Ibrahim Hamidi, a journalist and political analyst from the restive Syrian province of Idlib, said of the Islamic State. He has long argued that without more forceful international action against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and a political program to empower Sunnis, support for the extremists will grow.\n“This is part of what makes them so dangerous,” he said. “Defeating them needs a comprehensive approach.”\nSunnis form an aggrieved majority in Syria, where repression of a mostly Sunni uprising by Mr. Assad’s government, backed by Shiite-led Iran, exploded into war. And they are an aggrieved minority in Iraq, where Shiites are more numerous, after years of sectarian violence between Sunni and Shiite militias.\nBut little has been done to give Sunnis a greater role in their own governance. Mr. Assad remains in power, backed by Iran and the militant group Hezbollah. And American officials are fighting an uphill battle to persuade Sunnis in Iraq to fight ISIS alongside the Shiite-led central government and Iranian-backed militias.\nThat, Mr. Hamidi and other analysts said, has left some Sunnis willing to tolerate the Islamic State in areas where they lack another defender, especially in conservative communities like the ones in western Iraq and eastern Syria, where the group is strongest. The analysts emphasized that most Sunnis do not support the Islamic State’s harsh interpretation of Islam, or its brutality, but that some were becoming more susceptible to its political talk about protecting oppressed Sunnis.\n“Now, with the sectarian polarization of the region, under the skin of every single Sunni there is a tiny Daesh,” Mr. Hamidi, a Sunni, said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.\nBy attacking ISIS in Syria while doing nothing to stop Mr. Assad from bombing Sunni areas that have rebelled, he added, the United States-led campaign was driving some Syrians into the Islamic State camp. “The coalition is scratching the skin and making this Daesh come out.”\nA slang word has even emerged, aid workers in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon say, for someone who supports ISIS just a little bit. Some people say, with a hint of sheepishness, “I’m a Dawoosh,” using an Arabic diminutive that suggests “a cute little Daesh.”\nIn Iraq, the Islamic State has largely engulfed a pre-existing Sunni insurgency. It has deeper roots there, having grown out of Al Qaeda in Iraq, that sprang from resistance to United States after the 2003 invasion.\nIn 2006, Iraq became embroiled in civil war, with Sunni and Shiite militias carrying out sectarian attacks on civilians. Now, some of those Shiite militias are among the most effective forces on the ground after the partial collapse of the Iraqi Army. But there have been reports of revenge killings by the militias, and some Sunnis trust them so little that they prefer the Islamic State.\nThe situation in Syria is similar in some ways, with Mr. Assad relying on support from Iran and Iranian-backed militias. But the Islamic State faces greater challenges winning popular support in Syria, where its Iraqi leadership is viewed as foreign and where there remains a significant collection of Sunni insurgent groups opposed to both the Islamic State and the government.\nWashington is trying to recruit some of those rival groups to be trained and equipped as a front-line force against the Islamic State in Syria. But the program is small, with only 90 fighters in the first round of training, and recruiting is a challenge, since most Syrian insurgents place the highest priority on fighting the Assad government.\nAlso arrayed against the Islamic State in Syria are many hard-line Islamist groups, including the Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front. They can match the Islamic State in espousing Sunni sectarian views, condemning minority sects, and reject its claim to represent Sunnis, calling them instead “khawarej,” a term from Islamic history signifying divisive outsiders.\nThe Islamic State has made more inroads in areas where either it or the government has stamped out alternative insurgent forces. That was the case in Palmyra, the first city the group took directly from government forces, which had crushed a rebellion there in 2012.\nOne resident of Palmyra who opposes both the Islamic State and the government said it was trying to persuade townspeople to view it as a liberator.\n“For the last seven years, they have been winning hearts and minds in Iraq,” he said, using only a nickname, Dahham, for safety reasons. “This is the same approach they are using in Palmyra, and nobody stood against them.”\nRami Jarrah, an antigovernment activist who also opposes ISIS, said the group scored a victory by destroying Tadmur Prison. The site has powerful resonance across the spectrum of opponents of Mr. Assad, from secular communists to Sunni Islamists accused of taking part in a Muslim Brotherhood insurgency that was crushed in the 1980s.\nSyrians who lost loved ones to abuses by the governments of Mr. Assad and his father, Hafez al-Assad, may now feel that while global powers ignored their pleas for help, “justice has been met at the hands of extremist militants,” Mr. Jarrah wrote on Facebook.\nWith the recent gains by the Islamic State, Washington is tinkering with tactics and weapons. Anti-tank missiles are on their way to Iraq, to destroy American tanks that the group took from fleeing Iraqi soldiers.\nBut United States military support has its limits, given the Iraqi Army’s weakness, which in turn reflects the divisions that have made Iraqi national unity elusive.\n“ISIS can only really be defeated by the Sunnis in Iraq,” said Emma Sky, a Briton who was a political adviser to the American military in Iraq. That is what happened in 2006, when the American military established the Awakening program, paying Sunni tribes to switch sides and fight Al Qaeda in Iraq and the greater Sunni insurgency.\nThe United States, unable to act unilaterally as it did in 2006, is now pushing the Iraqi government to arm Sunni tribes to fight the Islamic State, but little has happened in the face of objections by harder-line Shiite leaders. There is also a reluctance among Sunnis to fight ISIS, because many do not see being governed by Baghdad as something worth fighting for.\n“We need assurances that those who are fighting against Daesh will have rights and be treated like Iraqis,” said Osama Nujaifi, a vice president of Iraq and a Sunni.\nSome Iraqi Sunnis, having seen what ultimately happened with the Awakening, take a once bitten, twice shy approach now. Envisioned as a long-term effort to empower the Sunni community, the Awakening collapsed because the Shiite-led Iraqi government never fulfilled promises of full- time jobs to the Awakening fighters.\nSheikh Wissam al-Hardan, a Sunni from Anbar Province who is loyal to the government, said that Sunni fighters still on the payroll of what remains of the Awakening groups had not been paid in 15 months.\n“There is no reconciliation between the government and the Sunnis,” he said. “The government considers them as if they are all ISIS.”\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 37

But even here, poverty and exclusion threaten to rob them of a voice in determining their own future.\nThe boatloads of Rohingya migrants who landed here desperate and exhausted last month join some 75,000 Rohingya who made their way to Malaysia years and even decades before. Judging by the hardships their forerunners face, it will be difficult for the latest wave either to establish a secure foothold or to achieve resettlement elsewhere.\n“From a country, we have become stateless, and as refugees, we have become stateless again,” said Mohammed Noor, the managing director of Rohingya Vision TV, an online news service based in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. “We’re a floating people now, floating everywhere without any hope, without any papers.”\nPrayers and speeches here on Wednesday marked the third anniversary of the bloodshed in Myanmar that started the latest exodus, but in the larger regional debate over their future, the Rohingya have largely been left as muted bystanders.\nIn Malaysia, their status as refugees and unregistered migrants bars them from sending their children to government schools, meaning many receive little or no education. They are also barred from holding jobs legally, but necessity compels most of the men to find menial off-the-books labor.\n“Decades of policies in Myanmar have left many Rohingya illiterate and impoverished, and that’s hard to shake off as refugees,” said Gerhard Hoffstaedter, an anthropologist from the University of Queensland in Australia who studies the Rohingya and other refugee groups in Malaysia.\nEchoing the views of other experts and Rohingya leaders and organizers in Malaysia, Dr. Hoffstaedter said that many of the refugees’ problems were partly rooted in their own society.\nThe Rohingya “lack the organization and rich networks that other, more successful refugee groups can tap,” he said. He noted that the Chin, another migrant group from Myanmar, have been more successful at setting up schools and at securing resettlement in third countries, especially the United States.\n“The Rohingya have an amazing capacity for suffering, but they’ve been given so few stories of success,” he said.\nEven so, compared with the bamboo shacks and fetid detention camps they left behind, Malaysia offers at least some modicum of hope and opportunity, if not the kinder reception, decent jobs and schools, and swift resettlement that many hoped for.\nThe Rohingya have managed to establish enclaves in several neighborhoods on the edges of Kuala Lumpur, the capital, living in concrete housing blocks and shopping in open-air markets. Here in the Ampang district, tens of thousands of Rohingya crowd into apartments and dilapidated houses that often hold several families each.\nMany Rohingya men find occasional work on construction sites or in cheap restaurants in the city, and some women work in stalls and shops. In the Selayang neighborhood, hundreds of Rohingya stall holders sell fruit and vegetables, mixing with other poor migrants, including many from Myanmar.\n“We are not rich people, but this is better than what we left behind,” said Mohammed Ayub, a Rohingya who has lived in Malaysia for three years and runs a tailor shop in Taman Muda on the edge of Kuala Lumpur. “What is most important is that we have some security here. We don’t have much, but we have some security.”\nMost pressing of all, many migrants said they faced a long, uncertain wait for the United Nations refugee agency office in Kuala Lumpur to accredit them as refugees, which would entitle them to a precious identity card that many see as their best protection against detention or abuse by officials and the police.\n“It’s almost impossible to get the U.N. card,” said Ambiya Kadahusan, a 21-year-old Rohingya who said she applied nearly a year ago and had yet to receive a response. “Without a card, we feel it’s unsafe to go out and look for work, or even visit friends.\n“The police check: ‘Where are you from? Are you a Bangladeshi worker?’ And sometimes you have to pay some money to be let go.”\nRecent arrivals often turn to the Rohingya Society in Malaysia, which supplies them with papers listing their names, birth dates and backgrounds. The society also issues semblances of official documents like marriage certificates and divorce papers that migrants cannot get from the Malaysian government.\nThe Rohingya have also tried to overcome their hardships by establishing rudimentary schools; by helping one another find work; and by joining organizations that provide services, advice and a sense of solidarity.\n“The Rohingya are actively employing strategies of community self-protection,” said Matthew Smith, an executive director of Fortify Rights, an organization based in Bangkok that monitors refugee conditions in the region. “The government of Malaysia is not providing adequate protection, and so they have to draw more on their own resources.”\nThose resources are limited by the migrants’ poverty and by the desperate needs of the recent arrivals.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said it was supporting 31 “learning centers” across Malaysia for Rohingya children, and other schools operate without United Nations support. But Abdul Ghani, the president of the Myanmar Ethnic Rohingyas Human Rights Organization Malaysia, said that only a small fraction of Rohingya children in Malaysia received a steady education.\nAccess to medical care can be another problem. “I try to help these people, because I have also suffered,” said Ismail Ahmad, a Rohingya practitioner of traditional medicine who fled Myanmar in 2007 and said he was helping about 60 migrants, many of them recent arrivals. “But we don’t have much money for medicine or food, so often there is not much we can do.”\nMr. Ahmad showed a poultice of herbs wrapped in cloth and tied around a warm brick, which he used to treat paralysis and cramps that migrants suffer after long sea voyages.\n“Sometimes they have lived for two or three months in the hold, and so they cannot walk by themselves,” he said. “But this is the best treatment we can offer.”\nMany Rohingya believe that their circumstances here are part of an elaborate plot by the Myanmar government to keep them weak and stigmatized, even in exile. Myanmar, an overwhelmingly Buddhist country, considers the Rohingya illegitimate Muslim intruders from what is now Bangladesh, and in 1982 it stripped many Rohingya of citizenship.\nAbout 200 men gathered in a spare concrete hall in Ampang on Wednesday for the anniversary of the killing of 10 Rohingya by villagers in Rakhine State in western Myanmar, after three Rohingya were accused of raping and murdering a Buddhist woman. The violence signaled the start of a wave of persecution that has prompted hundreds of thousands to flee the country.\nThe gathering at the hall was a rare display of collective political assertion by the Rohingya in Malaysia, many of whom wore red T-shirts proclaiming their ethnicity.\nNoting that the hall was only half full, Faridullah bin Dudumiya, a Muslim cleric who has lived as a refugee here for 25 years, said he was both proud and a little discouraged. “It’s not often we’re acting as a community,” Mr. Faridullah, 47, said. “But it seems our voice is still not strong enough, even on this day.”\n“It’s difficult,” he added. “We are illegal people.”\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 38

But the documents also note that the N.S.A. sought to target hackers even when it could not establish any links to foreign powers.\nThe disclosures, based on documents provided by Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, and shared with The New York Times and ProPublica, come at a time of unprecedented cyberattacks on American financial institutions, businesses and government agencies, but also of greater scrutiny of secret legal justifications for broader government surveillance.\nWhile the Senate passed legislation this week limiting some of the N.S.A.’s authority, it involved provisions in the U.S.A. Patriot Act and did not apply to the warrantless wiretapping program.\nGovernment officials defended the N.S.A.’s monitoring of suspected hackers as necessary to shield Americans from the increasingly aggressive activities of foreign governments. But critics say it raises difficult trade-offs that should be subject to public debate.\nThe N.S.A.’s activities run “smack into law enforcement land,” said Jonathan Mayer, a cybersecurity scholar at Stanford Law School who has researched privacy issues and who reviewed several of the documents. “That’s a major policy decision about how to structure cybersecurity in the U.S. and not a conversation that has been had in public.”\nIt is not clear what standards the agency is using to select targets. It can be hard to know for sure who is behind a particular intrusion — a foreign government or a criminal gang — and the N.S.A. is supposed to focus on foreign intelligence, not law enforcement.\nThe government can also gather significant volumes of Americans’ information — anything from private emails to trade secrets and business dealings — through Internet surveillance because monitoring the data flowing to a hacker involves copying that information as the hacker steals it.\nOne internal N.S.A. document notes that agency surveillance activities through “hacker signatures pull in a lot.”\nBrian Hale, the spokesman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said, “It should come as no surprise that the U.S. government gathers intelligence on foreign powers that attempt to penetrate U.S. networks and steal the private information of U.S. citizens and companies.” He added that “targeting overseas individuals engaging in hostile cyberactivities on behalf of a foreign power is a lawful foreign intelligence purpose.”\nThe effort is the latest known expansion of the N.S.A.’s warrantless surveillance program, which allows the government to intercept Americans’ cross-border communications if the target is a foreigner abroad. While the N.S.A. has long searched for specific email addresses and phone numbers of foreign intelligence targets, the Obama administration three years ago started allowing the agency to search its communications streams for less-identifying Internet protocol addresses or strings of harmful computer code.\nThe surveillance activity traces to changes that began after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The government tore down a so-called wall that prevented intelligence and criminal investigators from sharing information about suspected spies and terrorists. The barrier had been erected to protect Americans’ rights because intelligence investigations use lower legal standards than criminal inquiries, but policy makers decided it was too much of an obstacle to terrorism investigations.\nThe N.S.A. also started the warrantless wiretapping program, which caused an outcry when it was disclosed in 2005. In 2008, under the FISA Amendments Act, Congress legalized the surveillance program so long as the agency targeted only noncitizens abroad. A year later, the new Obama administration began crafting a new cybersecurity policy — including weighing whether the Internet had made the distinction between a spy and a criminal obsolete.\n“Reliance on legal authorities that make theoretical distinctions between armed attacks, terrorism and criminal activity may prove impractical,” the White House National Security Council wrote in a classified annex to a policy report in May 2009, which was included in the N.S.A.’s internal files.\nAbout that time, the documents show, the N.S.A. — whose mission includes protecting military and intelligence networks against intruders — proposed using the warrantless surveillance program for cybersecurity purposes. The agency received “guidance on targeting using the signatures” from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, according to an internal newsletter.\nIn May and July 2012, according to an internal timeline, the Justice Department granted its secret approval for the searches of cybersignatures and Internet addresses. The Justice Department tied that authority to a pre-existing approval by the secret surveillance court permitting the government to use the program to monitor foreign governments.\nThat limit meant the N.S.A. had to have some evidence for believing that the hackers were working for a specific foreign power. That rule, the N.S.A. soon complained, left a “huge collection gap against cyberthreats to the nation” because it is often hard to know exactly who is behind an intrusion, according to an agency newsletter. Different computer intruders can use the same piece of malware, take steps to hide their location or pretend to be someone else.\nSo the N.S.A., in 2012, began pressing to go back to the surveillance court and seek permission to use the program explicitly for cybersecurity purposes. That way, it could monitor international communications for any “malicious cyberactivity,” even if it did not yet know who was behind the attack.\nThe newsletter described the further expansion as one of “highest priorities” of the N.S.A. director, Gen. Keith B. Alexander. However, a former senior intelligence official said that the government never asked the court to grant that authority.\nMeanwhile, the F.B.I. in 2011 had obtained a new kind of wiretap order from the secret surveillance court for cybersecurity investigations, permitting it to target Internet data flowing to or from specific Internet addresses linked to certain governments.\nTo carry out the orders, the F.B.I. negotiated in 2012 to use the N.S.A.’s system for monitoring Internet traffic crossing “chokepoints operated by U.S. providers through which international communications enter and leave the United States,” according to a 2012 N.S.A. document. The N.S.A. would send the intercepted traffic to the bureau’s “cyberdata repository” in Quantico, Virginia.\nThe disclosure that the N.S.A. and the F.B.I. have expanded their cybersurveillance adds a dimension to a recurring debate over the post-Sept. 11 expansion of government spying powers: Information about Americans sometimes gets swept up incidentally when foreigners are targeted, and prosecutors can use that information in criminal cases.\nCiting the potential for a copy of data “exfiltrated” by a hacker to contain “so much” information about Americans, one N.S.A. lawyer suggested keeping the stolen data out of the agency’s regular repository for information collected by surveillance so that analysts working on unrelated issues could not query it, a 2010 training document showed. But it is not clear whether the agency or the F.B.I. has imposed any additional limits on the data of hacking victims.\nIn a response to questions for this article, the F.B.I. pointed to its existing procedures for protecting victims’ data acquired during investigations, but also said it continually reviewed its policies “to adapt to these changing threats while protecting civil liberties and the interests of victims of cybercrimes.”\nNone of these actions or proposals had been disclosed to the public. As recently as February, when President Obama spoke about cybersecurity at an event at Stanford University, he lauded the importance of transparency but did not mention this change.\n“The technology so often outstrips whatever rules and structures and standards have been put in place, which means that government has to be constantly self-critical and we have to be able to have an open debate about it,” Mr. Obama said.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 39

At 9:05 p.m. Monday, they spoke by cellphone with relatives back home in Shanghai, and everything seemed fine. Nothing was said about the weather or the rain showers in the area.\nBut less than 25 minutes later, a violent storm capsized the ship. Of the 456 passengers, only 14 are believed to have survived, including the captain. One of the survivors said he swam until dawn.\nOn Thursday, three days after the accident, the victims’ grieving families were still searching for answers about what happened that evening; why the captain was one of the few survivors; and more grimly, when the bodies of their loved ones would be recovered from the wreckage.\nThe confirmed death toll increased to 77 on Thursday, according to China Central Television, and about 1,200 family members have arrived in Jianli County, where the accident occurred, officials said.\nIn all, 442 people are presumed dead, including Mr. Yang, Ms. Chen and their granddaughter, one of the youngest passengers on a ship that was filled mostly with retirees in their 60s and 70s. It is one of the worst maritime accidents in Asia in decades.\n“Yesterday was children’s day, and today, I have no idea whether my child is alive or not,” Tang Xia, the girl’s mother, said, sobbing Tuesday afternoon at a local government bureau where parents had gathered hoping for word about their loved ones. “I’m waiting desperately for any updates, or any official who can talk with me.”\nMany families are still hoping that, by some miracle, someone will be found alive.\nThe government has not released an official passenger list of those aboard the Oriental Star, nor has the cruise ship operator, the Chongqing Oriental Ferry Company, although various websites have published what purport to be passenger lists.\nFamilies have expressed anger and frustration at the slow response from the government, the ship operator and the travel agencies involved, with some of them saying they have not been formally contacted or informed about the investigation.\nIn a sign of the high-level attention being focused on the disaster, President Xi Jinping held a meeting on Thursday of the Politburo Standing Committee, the highest echelon of political power in China, to discuss the rescue efforts. It found them satisfactory.\n“In handling the response to this emergency, related aspects reacted with urgency, provided orderly assistance and took efficient steps,” the committee said, according to a summary from the official Xinhua news agency.\nThe Chinese leadership ordered a detailed investigation into the cause of the ship’s sinking that “didn’t let any doubtful point slip by,” Xinhua said.\nIt also directed how grieving family members should be approached.\n“It is extremely important to help family members deal with the aftermath,” the committee said, adding that officials should “empathize with family members’ suffering, do a good job of placating them and conscientiously maintain social stability,” according to Xinhua.\nMany grieving families have traveled to Hubei Province in central China to watch the rescue operation or to wait for the bodies to be recovered. Others have organized support groups online and started sharing photographs of friends and family members, as well as pictures of the journey that passengers had posted online before the accident.\nWhen tragedies occur in China, families often direct their anger at the government. When news of the disaster spread on Tuesday, families in Shanghai descended upon one of the travel agencies for answers. After the police directed them to a local government petition bureau, they cried, pleaded for answers and lashed out at local officials. One group tore down a government barricade.\n“We have a right to tell our story,” said a woman named Wang, after government officers asked her to stop giving interviews on Tuesday. “This is our freedom. We’ve lost our relatives.”\nIn Jianli County in Hubei Province, where the ship capsized, the authorities have begun lining up special coffins, decorated with flowers, in anticipation of the huge numbers of bodies that are expected to be found in the days ahead. The authorities are aware of the potential for excruciatingly grim scenes because many of the bodies may have decomposed and been disfigured by being underwater for days.\nMore than 1,100 responders and 100 boats were participating in rescue efforts, the Jianli County chief, Huang Zhen, told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. Local residents and hotels are providing free accommodations, and government employees are providing support for relatives of ship passengers, Mr. Huang said.\nRescue workers have begun to cut holes in the hull of the ship, which is floating bottom side up, hoping to find survivors. Officials have also discussed lifting the entire boat out of the river.\nThe Transport Ministry said an operation to right the capsized ship was to begin Thursday night, Xinhua reported.\nMany of the passengers on the Oriental Star had come from Shanghai, where they had booked the trip through a tourist agency. Chen Guiyu said three of her four sisters and two brothers-in-law had joined a large tour group for the cruise, which was to last about 10 days.\nHer eldest sister, Chengying, had just celebrated her 70th birthday, and they seemed pleased with the ship’s accommodations. They even sent back photographs, which they posted on the social networking site WeChat, showing them posing at various sites and even washing clothes along the river during one of the stops.\nIn a telephone interview on Thursday, Ms. Chen said she and other family members had boarded a train bound for Hubei Province. She said that her five family members had been confirmed dead. The last time she heard from the family was 7:53 p.m. Monday, when one of her sisters, Guiying, posted a group of photos online.\n“I never heard there were any concerns about the weather,” Ms. Chen said. “All they told us was how luxurious the ship was, and how happy they were. My sister and I replied to them via WeChat, and said, ‘Enjoy yourself in this rare get-together.’ ”\nLess than two hours later, in stormy weather, they most likely perished after the Oriental Star made a sharp change of direction and then capsized in water 50 feet deep.\nIn Shanghai, Chen Lindi and her family were preparing to travel to Hubei Province to identify her relatives’ bodies. The government had bought six high-speed rail tickets for Ms. Chen to go and identify the bodies of her relatives — her sister and brother-in-law, Chen Cailian and Mr. Yang, and their granddaughter, Chenlin — once they are recovered.\nChenlin loved Hello Kitty, so her mother is carrying a Hello Kitty hair clip and a princess dress. The parents are holding out hope that Chenlin and her grandparents might have survived.\n“She was going to perform an Indian dance, and play the guzheng,” a traditional Chinese string instrument, her aunt, Chen Lindi, said by telephone on Thursday. “She had rehearsed for the Indian dance before leaving.”\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 40

Everything has been burnt down,” said Mr. Vanderpuije, who added that he had visited the scene Thursday morning with Ghana’s president, John Dramani Mahama. “All the vehicles in the filling station have been burned. We saw bodies there. It’s a major disaster.”\nOne witness said that a bus packed with passengers parked at the station had caught fire and all on board had died.\nFrancis Boateng, a Red Cross official in Accra, said that the rain began three days ago and that water had flooded the gas station’s fuel storage. “The fire was on the water,” he said. “There are so many people who were consumed by the fire.”\nMr. Boateng put the death toll at around 90 and said the search for bodies was continuing in the high waters.\nGhanaian news outlets reported that the flooding had impeded rescue workers, and that ambulances had been late to arrive at the scene. Early Thursday morning, two vans packed with charred bodies left for the morgue, but a military hospital reported that the morgue was at capacity and could not take any more of the dead.\nTouring the disaster scene, Mr. Mahama said, “The loss of lives is catastrophic and almost unprecedented.”\nHe was critical of the disorderly approach to construction in the capital, which exacerbates flooding during periods of heavy rain.\n“We should not continue to be like the vulture who says he would roof his house when the rain comes,” Mr. Mahama said.\nFlooding has battered the already shaky power infrastructure in the capital, where the electricity deficit has brought thousands of demonstrators into the streets this year and hurt the country’s economy.\nGhana’s currency has dropped precipitously against the dollar over the past year, and the country was forced to seek a three-year loan of more than $900 million from the International Monetary Fund, even as the fund was critical of the government’s undisciplined public spending.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 41

And if anyone else knows, I do,” Mr. Warner said in his home country of Trinidad and Tobago on Wednesday, referring to Mr. Blatter’s decision this week to resign after 17 years at the helm of FIFA, soccer’s governing body. Mr. Warner, who said he feared for his own life, also said he had evidence linking FIFA to his country’s 2010 election.\nMr. Warner was once a close ally of Chuck Blazer, the former general secretary of Concacaf, the governing body that oversees soccer in North America, Central America and the Caribbean. Mr. Blazer has admitted taking bribes from bidders seeking to host the 1998 and 2010 World Cups and is now cooperating with the American authorities. On Wednesday, a judge in New York ordered the release of a redacted version of his plea hearing in 2013.\nMr. Warner’s sons, Daryan and Daryll, are also cooperating with the authorities, having secretly pleaded guilty in 2013 after they tried to deposit more than $600,000 in nearly two dozen United States bank accounts in an attempt to avoid detection.\nDuring a rambling and sometimes incoherent seven-minute television address, called “The Gloves Are Off,” Mr. Warner invoked Gandhi and sought to cast himself as a victim. In his speech, a paid political advertisement, he said he had reams of documents, including copies of checks, linking Mr. Blatter and other senior FIFA officials to an effort to manipulate a 2010 election in Trinidad and Tobago.\nHe said he had delivered his files to “respectable persons” and lawyers, and he warned that he had an “avalanche” of additional evidence.\n“I will no longer keep secrets for them who now seek to destroy the country which I love,” he said.\nMr. Warner’s television address came just four days after he vigorously defended himself in an online video, saying the charges against him were a conspiracy cooked up by the United States.\n“All this has stemmed from the failed U.S. bid to host the World Cup,” he said of the indictment then.\n“I could understand the U.S. embarrassment,” Mr. Warner continued, but it is important to “take your losses like a man.”\nIn the video, posted Sunday on his personal website, Facebook page and YouTube channel, he cited an article from The Onion that he said backed up his claims, apparently unaware that it was satire. He also told his supporters that he was innocent of the charges against him. “At the end of the day, all of the allegations against me shall be proven to be unfounded,” he said.\nIt was not clear why FIFA would want to intervene in the country’s electoral process, and Mr. Warner did not immediately provide any evidence in the television address on Wednesday to support his claims.\n“I apologize for not disclosing my knowledge of these events before,” Mr. Warner said, calling himself a “lone isolated soldier.” He said conditions in the jail where he was held briefly after his arrest last week had been “woeful.”\nHe said nothing would prevent him from revealing details of the scandal. “Not even death will stop the avalanche that is coming,” he told his supporters. “The die is cast. There can be no turning back. Let the chips fall where they fall.” Paraphrasing Gandhi, he said that throughout history, tyrants have fallen in the end.\nMr. Warner also said he felt threatened, saying, “I reasonably actually fear for my life.” Yet shortly after the speech was broadcast, he appeared at a rally for his Independent Liberal Party, and seemed resolute.\nMr. Warner faces a raft of charges, including racketeering, bribery, wire fraud and money laundering, but he denies the accusations. In 2004, as FIFA’s executive committee was deliberating where to hold the 2010 World Cup, South Africa’s government arranged for what amounted to a $10 million bribe to Mr. Warner and others in exchange for their votes, prosecutors say.\nAccording to the indictment, which was handed down May 20 but announced last week, when FIFA was considering which country would host the 2006 World Cup, Mr. Warner sent a relative to a Paris hotel room to collect a briefcase filled with $10,000 in cash from a South African bid committee official.\nSouth Africa has emphatically denied giving any bribes to ensure that it would host the tournament, but news reports on Thursday said the country’s organized-crime unit had opened a preliminary investigation into the bribery accusations.\nThe Australian police are also investigating corruption accusations in connection to the country’s bid for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, amid allegations that funds were misappropriated. The chairman of Football Federation Australia, Frank Lowy, published an open letter on Wednesday in which he cited an investigation by Concacaf showing that Mr. Warner had committed fraud and misappropriated the funds.\nAustralian officials in recent days have been expressing their deep disappointment at losing the World Cup to Qatar, and some critics of the Qatari bid are hoping that it will lose the tournament, even as officials there insist that their bid was above reproach and that the tournament is not under threat. The sports minister of the Australian state of Victoria, John Eren, said his country could host the World Cup “tomorrow.”\nElsewhere, the former England soccer captain David Beckham added his voice to those in European soccer who have grown weary of Mr. Blatter. “I hope at last we are now moving in the right direction,” he was quoted as saying by the BBC. “Some of the things that we now know happened were despicable, unacceptable and awful for the game we love so much.”\nMr. Beckham, who rose to global stardom playing for Manchester United, was a central supporter of England’s unsuccessful bid to host the World Cup in 2018, which was awarded to Russia.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 42

The scandal has now emboldened and invigorated pro-Moscow forces in the tug of war over former Soviet lands.\nIurie Leanca, Moldova’s prime minister until early this year, said he knew his country’s lenders “were going in the wrong direction” because of huge “toxic loans” to insiders. But little could be done, he said, “because institutions simply do not work here.”\n“Only when you become prime minister do you realize how rotten the whole system is,” he added.\nThe events first came dimly to light in November, when Moldova’s central bank took control of Banca de Economii, one of the country’s biggest lenders, and then two other troubled institutions, Banca Sociala and Unibank.\nThen, in May, Andrian Candu, a powerful politician, used his personal blog to leak a confidential report commissioned by the central bank and conducted by the investigations company Kroll.\nThe report named Ilan Shor, a 28-year-old Moldovan oligarch who bought into ownership of Banca de Economii in 2013, as the protagonist in “a coordinated effort involving all three banks working together to extract as much loan finance as possible from the banks without any obvious business rationale.”\nLoans at one bank were paid off with loans from another bank and were then followed by yet more borrowing, the report revealed.\n“It was like a carousel,” said Mr. Candu, who is the speaker of the Moldovan Parliament and a close political ally and personal friend of Moldova’s richest oligarch, Vladimir Plahotniuc.\nFrom September 2010 to November 2014, the report said, companies linked to Mr. Shor increased their borrowing from banks a hundredfold to the equivalent of nearly $750 million at current exchange rates. Factoring in interest, Mr. Shor’s group now owes around $1 billion. It shows no sign of returning this.\nMr. Shor, now under house arrest at his sprawling residential compound in Chisinau, the capital, declined to be interviewed for this article. But, in an emailed response to written questions, he denied allegations that he had orchestrated a swindle, saying there was “no documentary evidence” to support Kroll’s conclusions of deliberate looting.\nThe reason for that is perhaps the fate of the Volkswagen van, reduced to a charred wreck by a mysterious fire and now held in a police lot here in Ialoveni, a small town southwest of Chisinau. The van, owned by the security company Klassica Force, was carrying 12 sacks of loan documents from Banca de Economii when it was reported stolen and caught fire “under suspicious circumstances,” according to the Kroll report.\nOther than Mr. Shor, nobody seems to believe the van was stolen and burned by thieves, despite a police report to that effect.\nMr. Candu dismissed the stolen van report as a “primitive scheme” to hide the traces of an elaborate theft that shifted hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore accounts.\n“It was a stupid mistake,” he said. “You can’t just burn a car and think everything disappears. Money leaves a trace.”\nMr. Shor scoffed at the idea of a cover-up, saying that only “illiterate persons” would try to conceal their tracks by burning documents that have digital and other copies. “It makes no sense to burn any of them, even if this could come into somebody’s mind,” he said.\nThe Klassica Force van, he said, was the object of a straightforward “cash-in-transit vehicle theft.”\nDorin Dragutanu, the governor of Moldova’s central bank, said he believed the theft and the fire had been staged. But the real purpose, he said, was to hide the likelihood that Banca de Economii had no real documents to account for its lending.\n“If you have transactions that are fake and don’t have any paperwork, you need to show somehow that the documents disappeared,” he said.\nThe scandal has been a political gift for the zealously pro-Russian Socialist Party, the largest group in Parliament after elections late last year, just days after news of the banking crisis first broke. Bolstered by the public reaction to details that surfaced in May, the party is expected to do well in local elections this month.\nIgor Dodon, the leader of the Socialists, said the disappearance of so much money showed how the European Union had backed the wrong horse by supporting Moldova’s pro-European forces, which had held power since 2009. “The more money Europe gives, the more money our oligarchs steal,” he said.\nPro-European politicians say the roots of the scandal came from an earlier period of left-wing rule. Mr. Candu, the parliamentary speaker and a champion of closer links with the West, said Banca de Economii had been known for more than a decade “as a milk cow” for previous Communist-led governments.\n“It was always a place for fraud,” he said.\nWhen Mr. Shor married a Russian pop star in 2011, Mr. Dodon and two previous Moldovan presidents, both from the Communist Party, attended a lavish reception in Chisinau, along with many other prominent politicians and business figures.\nToday, former associates are distancing themselves from Mr. Shor, who is also running in elections this month, a candidacy that shields him from prosecution, despite his house arrest. Police officers armed with automatic weapons guard his vast residence around the clock, as do Mr. Shor’s own security guards, hired from Klassica Force, the same company whose van carrying bank files was supposedly stolen and then set on fire.\nBorn in Israel into a Jewish family from Moldova that, according to Moldova’s anticorruption agency chief, had close ties to that country’s governing elite during Soviet rule, Mr. Shor was taken to Moldova as a child. Building on his father’s connections and business interests, he became one of Chisinau’s richest men, with stakes in banking, duty-free shops, a soccer team, insurance and other ventures.\nMr. Shor, in his written responses to questions, acknowledged that Banca de Economii had serious problems with “unfavorable” loans, but he said that those dated from the previous management and had been kept secret from him until after he bought into the bank’s ownership in 2013.\nHe said he had kept quiet about this “bomb” because going public at the time would have led to the “inevitable crash of the whole banking system.” All his moves since, he added, were simply “remedial actions” intended to save the bank.\nPrime Minister Chiril Gaburici, voicing a widespread view, said that he did not believe Mr. Shor was solely responsible for the missing money and that he must have had powerful accomplices. “I don’t think Mr. Shor could do this alone,” Mr. Gaburici said.\nPeople in government were probably involved, either directly, for personal gain or simply through inattention to what was going on, investigators here believe. But the question that most concerns the country is the one raised on national television by a journalist, Natalia Morari, who appeared on her evening show, “Politica,” wearing a T-shirt with the words, “Where’s the billion?”\nThat is unclear. The money lent by Banca de Economii and the other banks sloshed in and out of various foreign accounts, often held in Latvia, according to the Kroll report.\nAs the carousel of lending from bank to bank began to spin out of control, companies controlled by Mr. Shor transferred a total of $232.2 million, as well as 544.5 million euros, or almost $600 million, to mysterious offshore entities in just two days, Nov. 25 and 26, according to the Kroll report.\nShortly before this, Banca de Economii’s loan portfolio was abruptly moved, through a series of opaque transactions, to Banca Sociala. That bank then announced it had held a shareholders’ meeting in a remote Ukrainian town on Nov. 26 and decided to transfer collection rights on the loans to a British-registered company called Fortuna.\nThe next day, the van carrying bank documents was burned. Mr. Dragutanu, the central bank governor, said the shareholders’ meeting in Ukraine and the deal with Fortuna were “completely fake,” noting that Fortuna had supposedly agreed to pay full price for the loan portfolio, but not until 2019.\nAsked about the looting of Moldova’s banks at a news conference in Chisinau, the European Union’s ambassador to Moldava, Pirkka Tapiola, voiced the dismay that has gripped locals and foreign diplomats. “I do not have an answer for you on how it is possible to steal so much money from a small country,” he said.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 43

He was not present at the court.\nThe ruling was seen as a triumph of sorts for opponents of Mubarak who perceive his treatment by the courts as too lenient.\n\"I was sure of this ruling because there were many violations by the criminal court (which dropped the case). It confirms that the January revolution is claiming back its right,\" said Yasser Sayed Ahmed, a lawyer for victims of the violence during the uprising.\nLawyers told Reuters the court on Thursday upheld other cases that cleared Mubarak and his sons of graft charges. It also upheld a previous ruling that cleared Mubarak\'s former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, and six aides. The defendants had denied the charges.\nBut for some of Mubarak\'s opponents, the ruling did not go far enough.\n\"Today\'s ruling was issued with a final acquittal for Mubarak\'s regime over the killing of protesters under the leadership of Adly. Mubarak\'s retrial is just a red herring,\" Shadi El Ghazaly Harb, a prominent anti-Mubarak activist, said on his Facebook account.\nHundreds of people died when security forces clashed with protesters in the weeks before Mubarak was forced from power.\nMany Egyptians who lived through Mubarak\'s rule view it as a period of autocracy and crony capitalism. His overthrow led to Egypt\'s first free election, which brought in Islamist President Mohamed Mursi.\nBut Mursi only lasted a year in office after mass protests against his rule in 2013 prompted an overthrow by then army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who later went on to win a presidential election last year.\nSisi has since launched a crackdown on Mursi and his Muslim Brotherhood. Authorities have jailed thousands of Brotherhood supporters. Mursi himself may be facing a death sentence after a court sought to impose it on him.\nBy contrast, Mubarak-era figures are slowly being cleared of charges and a series of laws limiting political freedoms have raised fears that the old leadership is regaining influence.\nTEARS, SHOUTS IN COURT\nSupporters of Mubarak first erupted in applause because they thought he would not face another retrial but many later dissolved in tears and yelled at the judge\'s ruling.\n\"Egypt will never see stability as long as Mubarak is treated unfairly,\" said Aseela Abdelmoty.\nMubarak, who ruled Egypt with an iron first, has already spent at least three years in prison for other cases.\nLast month an Egyptian court sentenced the former ruler and his two sons to three years in jail without parole in the retrial of a corruption case.\nThe U.S.-backed Egyptian government says it is committed to democracy, and large-scale unrest in the Arab world\'s most populous country has ended.\nBut Sinai-based Islamist militants have launched an insurgency after Mursi was ousted and have killed hundreds of police and soldiers. Two tourism police were killed on Wednesday on a road near the Giza Pyramids.\nThe government does not make a distinction between such groups and the Brotherhood, which has been banned as a terrorist organization. The Brotherhood denies any link to recent violence and maintains it remains committed to peaceful activism.\nOn Thursday, a court in the southern province of Sohag sentenced 51 suspected Brotherhood supporters to between three and 10 years in jail over the killing of four people, including a police officer at a protest in 2014, judicial sources said. Three others were acquitted.\n(Additional reporting by Omar Fahmy,; Writing by Yara Bayoumy; Editing by Angus MacSwan)\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 44

He was still a juvenile. He wasn’t an adult,” he added. “This was not rape or anything like that. This was touching someone over their clothes.”\nMr. and Mrs. Duggar said they sent Josh to counseling and had him talk to the police.\nThe interview on Fox News, which was pretaped at the Duggars’ home in Arkansas, came roughly two weeks after TLC said it was withdrawing the Duggars’ reality show, “19 Kids and Counting,” from its lineup. The show follows the Duggar family — Mr. and Mrs. Duggar and their 19 children — who are conservative Christians.\nThat decision followed a report in In Touch magazine that Josh, now 27, had been investigated for molesting underage girls. Since TLC withdrew the show, at least 20 companies have distanced themselves from the program. Many have taken their ads off the show or are taking steps to do so.\nThe Duggar parents, teary-eyed and looking to each other for support, defended their decision to start the reality show despite their son’s conduct, saying they saw no reason for concern.\n“When they asked us to do that reality TV show, all of this had been taken care of five years before, and we had a clean bill of health from the state,” Mr. Duggar said.\nAsked what would happen to the Duggars, given the backlash, Mr. Duggar replied, “I don’t know if the rest of our family should be punished for the act of one of our children.”\n“We are fine whether they film us or not,” he added.\nMr. Duggar did not say whether TLC had indicated that the show would be canceled.\nMs. Kelly also spoke to two of the sisters, Jessa Seewald and Jill Dillard.

They dazzled Chinese hungry for change, and the concept of civil society took off. Within months, it seemed as if everyone was setting up an NGO.\nAs the state sought to control the phenomenon, the Gongo, or government-organized NGO, was born. Yet as China’s economy grew and society grew in complexity along with it, NGOs multiplied. Often they were unregistered or registered as businesses because of the financial and legal difficulties of operating independently of the state. Two decades later, there are many thousands of NGOs in China.\nLast Friday, the Communist Party announced that a Politburo meeting headed by President Xi Jinping had decided that party groups should be set up in social, cultural and economic organizations, thus potentially creating a host of Pongos, or party-organized NGOs. The announcement has stirred unease among some. \n‘‘Did you see the Politburo order?’’ an editor at a party newspaper asked, sotto voce, at a reception. ‘‘They’re going to set up party groups in all NGOs.’’\nI asked whether this would apply to foreign NGOs. Would the Gates Foundation soon have a party cell in its midst?\n‘‘They don’t need to do that,’’ he said. ‘‘The foreign NGO law will control the foreign NGOs. This will control the domestic NGOs.’’\nHe was referring to a draft law aimed at managing more closely the activities of overseas NGOs in China and their Chinese partners and limiting foreign funding for Chinese NGOs. It has been widely criticized by domestic and overseas rights advocates as repressive.\nWas Mr. Xi’s government taking another step away from authoritarianism toward a new kind of totalitarianism by spreading the party and its ideology into more and more areas, pushing out the gains by civil society since 1995, as some Chinese critics are whispering? Mr. Xi may be popular with the masses, but his emphasis on party growing and Maoist-style values has made some intellectuals, even businesspeople, uneasy.\nChinese are divided as to what the Politburo directive shows. To Zhang Zhiru, the head of the Shenzhen Chunfeng Labor Dispute Services Center, a small NGO, it shows the party is in trouble.\n‘‘Local cadres see that the party has lost control in all kinds of areas. That’s why this directive was issued,’’ Mr. Zhang wrote in a social media message.\nThe decay of its moral authority after decades of corruption and abuse of power is so advanced that this new push will not penetrate the grass roots where most NGOs are located, he predicted.\nTo Zhang Weiwei, a professor at Fudan University and a leading proponent of the authoritarian ‘‘China model’’ of political and economic development, the directive shows the party is flourishing.\n‘‘After Xi Jinping came to power, I’d say the biggest development is that the party is marching to the forefront,’’ he said. ‘‘This is the new normal.’’\nOn an organizational level, it is unclear how party groups would be inserted into small NGOs, said Shawn Shieh, a Hong Kong-based civil society specialist. A party cell usually consists of three people, he said. Some NGOs may number no more than half a dozen. ‘‘How are they going to fit three people into a small NGO?’’ he asked.\nStill, he said, ‘‘Over the last few years, local government and party organizations have clearly become more proactive about engaging with NGOs, so we may well see more progress in establishing party groups.’’\nThe directive did not appear to apply just to NGOs, but to all kinds of ‘‘mass,’’ or nonparty, organizations, an aspect of Mr. Xi’s program that has led some intellectuals to whisper of a creeping totalitarianism.\n‘‘Given that party strengthening and discipline is something that Xi Jinping has made a major theme of his administration, we can’t dismiss it as run of the mill,’’ Mr. Shieh said of the directive.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 46

That has allowed it to present itself as the sole guardian of Sunni interests in a vast territory cutting across Iraq and Syria.\nIdeologically unified, the Islamic State is emerging as a social and political movement in many Sunni areas, filling a void in the absence of solid national identity and security. At the same time, it responds brutally to any other Sunni group, militant or civilian, that poses a challenge to its supremacy.\nThat dual strategy, purporting to represent Sunni interests and attacking any group that vies to play the same role, has allowed it to grow in the face of withering airstrikes.\nWhile the Obama administration has focused on confronting the Islamic State militarily, experts say the group’s recent victories point to the need for a political component in the strategy to counter the group — even after nearly 4,000 airstrikes by the American-led coalition and what United States officials say are the deaths of 10,000 ISIS militants.\n“They are hijacking legitimate demands,” Ibrahim Hamidi, a journalist and political analyst from the restive Syrian province of Idlib, said of the Islamic State. He has long argued that without more forceful international action against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and a political program to empower Sunnis, support for the extremists will grow.\n“This is part of what makes them so dangerous,” he said. “Defeating them needs a comprehensive approach.”\nSunnis form an aggrieved majority in Syria, where repression of a mostly Sunni uprising by Mr. Assad’s government, backed by Shiite-led Iran, exploded into war. And they are an aggrieved minority in Iraq, where Shiites are more numerous, after years of sectarian violence between Sunni and Shiite militias.\nBut little has been done to give Sunnis a greater role in their own governance. Mr. Assad remains in power, backed by Iran and the militant group Hezbollah. And American officials are fighting an uphill battle to persuade Sunnis in Iraq to fight ISIS alongside the Shiite-led central government and Iranian-backed militias.\nThat, Mr. Hamidi and other analysts said, has left some Sunnis willing to tolerate the Islamic State in areas where they lack another defender, especially in conservative communities like the ones in western Iraq and eastern Syria, where the group is strongest. The analysts emphasized that most Sunnis do not support the Islamic State’s harsh interpretation of Islam, or its brutality, but that some were becoming more susceptible to its political talk about protecting oppressed Sunnis.\n“Now, with the sectarian polarization of the region, under the skin of every single Sunni there is a tiny Daesh,” Mr. Hamidi, a Sunni, said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.\nBy attacking ISIS in Syria while doing nothing to stop Mr. Assad from bombing Sunni areas that have rebelled, he added, the United States-led campaign was driving some Syrians into the Islamic State camp. “The coalition is scratching the skin and making this Daesh come out.”\nA slang word has even emerged, aid workers in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon say, for someone who supports ISIS just a little bit. Some people say, with a hint of sheepishness, “I’m a Dawoosh,” using an Arabic diminutive that suggests “a cute little Daesh.”\nIn Iraq, the Islamic State has largely engulfed a pre-existing Sunni insurgency. It has deeper roots there, having grown out of Al Qaeda in Iraq, that sprang from resistance to United States after the 2003 invasion.\nIn 2006, Iraq became embroiled in civil war, with Sunni and Shiite militias carrying out sectarian attacks on civilians. Now, some of those Shiite militias are among the most effective forces on the ground after the partial collapse of the Iraqi Army. But there have been reports of revenge killings by the militias, and some Sunnis trust them so little that they prefer the Islamic State.\nThe situation in Syria is similar in some ways, with Mr. Assad relying on support from Iran and Iranian-backed militias. But the Islamic State faces greater challenges winning popular support in Syria, where its Iraqi leadership is viewed as foreign and where there remains a significant collection of Sunni insurgent groups opposed to both the Islamic State and the government.\nWashington is trying to recruit some of those rival groups to be trained and equipped as a front-line force against the Islamic State in Syria. But the program is small, with only 90 fighters in the first round of training, and recruiting is a challenge, since most Syrian insurgents place the highest priority on fighting the Assad government.\nAlso arrayed against the Islamic State in Syria are many hard-line Islamist groups, including the Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front. They can match the Islamic State in espousing Sunni sectarian views, condemning minority sects, and reject its claim to represent Sunnis, calling them instead “khawarej,” a term from Islamic history signifying divisive outsiders.\nThe Islamic State has made more inroads in areas where either it or the government has stamped out alternative insurgent forces. That was the case in Palmyra, the first city the group took directly from government forces, which had crushed a rebellion there in 2012.\nOne resident of Palmyra who opposes both the Islamic State and the government said it was trying to persuade townspeople to view it as a liberator.\n“For the last seven years, they have been winning hearts and minds in Iraq,” he said, using only a nickname, Dahham, for safety reasons. “This is the same approach they are using in Palmyra, and nobody stood against them.”\nRami Jarrah, an antigovernment activist who also opposes ISIS, said the group scored a victory by destroying Tadmur Prison. The site has powerful resonance across the spectrum of opponents of Mr. Assad, from secular communists to Sunni Islamists accused of taking part in a Muslim Brotherhood insurgency that was crushed in the 1980s.\nSyrians who lost loved ones to abuses by the governments of Mr. Assad and his father, Hafez al-Assad, may now feel that while global powers ignored their pleas for help, “justice has been met at the hands of extremist militants,” Mr. Jarrah wrote on Facebook.\nWith the recent gains by the Islamic State, Washington is tinkering with tactics and weapons. Anti-tank missiles are on their way to Iraq, to destroy American tanks that the group took from fleeing Iraqi soldiers.\nBut United States military support has its limits, given the Iraqi Army’s weakness, which in turn reflects the divisions that have made Iraqi national unity elusive.\n“ISIS can only really be defeated by the Sunnis in Iraq,” said Emma Sky, a Briton who was a political adviser to the American military in Iraq. That is what happened in 2006, when the American military established the Awakening program, paying Sunni tribes to switch sides and fight Al Qaeda in Iraq and the greater Sunni insurgency.\nThe United States, unable to act unilaterally as it did in 2006, is now pushing the Iraqi government to arm Sunni tribes to fight the Islamic State, but little has happened in the face of objections by harder-line Shiite leaders. There is also a reluctance among Sunnis to fight ISIS, because many do not see being governed by Baghdad as something worth fighting for.\n“We need assurances that those who are fighting against Daesh will have rights and be treated like Iraqis,” said Osama Nujaifi, a vice president of Iraq and a Sunni.\nSome Iraqi Sunnis, having seen what ultimately happened with the Awakening, take a once bitten, twice shy approach now. Envisioned as a long-term effort to empower the Sunni community, the Awakening collapsed because the Shiite-led Iraqi government never fulfilled promises of full- time jobs to the Awakening fighters.\nSheikh Wissam al-Hardan, a Sunni from Anbar Province who is loyal to the government, said that Sunni fighters still on the payroll of what remains of the Awakening groups had not been paid in 15 months.\n“There is no reconciliation between the government and the Sunnis,” he said. “The government considers them as if they are all ISIS.”\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 47

But even here, poverty and exclusion threaten to rob them of a voice in determining their own future.\nThe boatloads of Rohingya migrants who landed here desperate and exhausted last month join some 75,000 Rohingya who made their way to Malaysia years and even decades before. Judging by the hardships their forerunners face, it will be difficult for the latest wave either to establish a secure foothold or to achieve resettlement elsewhere.\n“From a country, we have become stateless, and as refugees, we have become stateless again,” said Mohammed Noor, the managing director of Rohingya Vision TV, an online news service based in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. “We’re a floating people now, floating everywhere without any hope, without any papers.”\nPrayers and speeches here on Wednesday marked the third anniversary of the bloodshed in Myanmar that started the latest exodus, but in the larger regional debate over their future, the Rohingya have largely been left as muted bystanders.\nIn Malaysia, their status as refugees and unregistered migrants bars them from sending their children to government schools, meaning many receive little or no education. They are also barred from holding jobs legally, but necessity compels most of the men to find menial off-the-books labor.\n“Decades of policies in Myanmar have left many Rohingya illiterate and impoverished, and that’s hard to shake off as refugees,” said Gerhard Hoffstaedter, an anthropologist from the University of Queensland in Australia who studies the Rohingya and other refugee groups in Malaysia.\nEchoing the views of other experts and Rohingya leaders and organizers in Malaysia, Dr. Hoffstaedter said that many of the refugees’ problems were partly rooted in their own society.\nThe Rohingya “lack the organization and rich networks that other, more successful refugee groups can tap,” he said. He noted that the Chin, another migrant group from Myanmar, have been more successful at setting up schools and at securing resettlement in third countries, especially the United States.\n“The Rohingya have an amazing capacity for suffering, but they’ve been given so few stories of success,” he said.\nEven so, compared with the bamboo shacks and fetid detention camps they left behind, Malaysia offers at least some modicum of hope and opportunity, if not the kinder reception, decent jobs and schools, and swift resettlement that many hoped for.\nThe Rohingya have managed to establish enclaves in several neighborhoods on the edges of Kuala Lumpur, the capital, living in concrete housing blocks and shopping in open-air markets. Here in the Ampang district, tens of thousands of Rohingya crowd into apartments and dilapidated houses that often hold several families each.\nMany Rohingya men find occasional work on construction sites or in cheap restaurants in the city, and some women work in stalls and shops. In the Selayang neighborhood, hundreds of Rohingya stall holders sell fruit and vegetables, mixing with other poor migrants, including many from Myanmar.\n“We are not rich people, but this is better than what we left behind,” said Mohammed Ayub, a Rohingya who has lived in Malaysia for three years and runs a tailor shop in Taman Muda on the edge of Kuala Lumpur. “What is most important is that we have some security here. We don’t have much, but we have some security.”\nMost pressing of all, many migrants said they faced a long, uncertain wait for the United Nations refugee agency office in Kuala Lumpur to accredit them as refugees, which would entitle them to a precious identity card that many see as their best protection against detention or abuse by officials and the police.\n“It’s almost impossible to get the U.N. card,” said Ambiya Kadahusan, a 21-year-old Rohingya who said she applied nearly a year ago and had yet to receive a response. “Without a card, we feel it’s unsafe to go out and look for work, or even visit friends.\n“The police check: ‘Where are you from? Are you a Bangladeshi worker?’ And sometimes you have to pay some money to be let go.”\nRecent arrivals often turn to the Rohingya Society in Malaysia, which supplies them with papers listing their names, birth dates and backgrounds. The society also issues semblances of official documents like marriage certificates and divorce papers that migrants cannot get from the Malaysian government.\nThe Rohingya have also tried to overcome their hardships by establishing rudimentary schools; by helping one another find work; and by joining organizations that provide services, advice and a sense of solidarity.\n“The Rohingya are actively employing strategies of community self-protection,” said Matthew Smith, an executive director of Fortify Rights, an organization based in Bangkok that monitors refugee conditions in the region. “The government of Malaysia is not providing adequate protection, and so they have to draw more on their own resources.”\nThose resources are limited by the migrants’ poverty and by the desperate needs of the recent arrivals.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said it was supporting 31 “learning centers” across Malaysia for Rohingya children, and other schools operate without United Nations support. But Abdul Ghani, the president of the Myanmar Ethnic Rohingyas Human Rights Organization Malaysia, said that only a small fraction of Rohingya children in Malaysia received a steady education.\nAccess to medical care can be another problem. “I try to help these people, because I have also suffered,” said Ismail Ahmad, a Rohingya practitioner of traditional medicine who fled Myanmar in 2007 and said he was helping about 60 migrants, many of them recent arrivals. “But we don’t have much money for medicine or food, so often there is not much we can do.”\nMr. Ahmad showed a poultice of herbs wrapped in cloth and tied around a warm brick, which he used to treat paralysis and cramps that migrants suffer after long sea voyages.\n“Sometimes they have lived for two or three months in the hold, and so they cannot walk by themselves,” he said. “But this is the best treatment we can offer.”\nMany Rohingya believe that their circumstances here are part of an elaborate plot by the Myanmar government to keep them weak and stigmatized, even in exile. Myanmar, an overwhelmingly Buddhist country, considers the Rohingya illegitimate Muslim intruders from what is now Bangladesh, and in 1982 it stripped many Rohingya of citizenship.\nAbout 200 men gathered in a spare concrete hall in Ampang on Wednesday for the anniversary of the killing of 10 Rohingya by villagers in Rakhine State in western Myanmar, after three Rohingya were accused of raping and murdering a Buddhist woman. The violence signaled the start of a wave of persecution that has prompted hundreds of thousands to flee the country.\nThe gathering at the hall was a rare display of collective political assertion by the Rohingya in Malaysia, many of whom wore red T-shirts proclaiming their ethnicity.\nNoting that the hall was only half full, Faridullah bin Dudumiya, a Muslim cleric who has lived as a refugee here for 25 years, said he was both proud and a little discouraged. “It’s not often we’re acting as a community,” Mr. Faridullah, 47, said. “But it seems our voice is still not strong enough, even on this day.”\n“It’s difficult,” he added. “We are illegal people.”\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 48

One Drop, an iOS-based dashboard for information from Internet of things-enabled glucose meters (along with food and blood sugar information), received the Series A round from RRE, with additional participation from over four investors. The company raised a previous $1 million from investors this past April.\n\n\nOne Drop is the latest entrant into a super-crowded field of wearables and smartphone apps for diabetics. Because more and more diabetics are being diagnosed and a complicated confluence of Fitbits/Jawbone Ups and Apple Health devices being integrated into daily life, along with the fact that diabetics need to constantly monitor their condition, the field has been fertile entry for startups and biopharm giants alike. However, One Drop has one advantage: CEO Jeff Dachis started one of the world’s most influential digital agencies, and still maintains an impressive Rolodex.\n\n\nIn an interview, Dachis told Fast Company that \"One of the weird things about the diabetes industry is that a lot of companies are there to make money from someone with a chronic disease. What we want to do is to reduce the cost and complexity of managing diabetes for anyone with diabetes so they can stay more well, visit the doctor less, and generally be healthier. We think data-driven insights are an approach that will keep people more mindful about the tools they need.\"\n\n\nDachis, who has type 1 LADA diabetes, declined to state how many users the app has.

But in the Netherlands, a group of innovators figured out how to create a system that could be used on the country\'s huge inventory of low-income housing.\nThe mid-century rental houses, built in townhouse-like rows, all have a similar layout, so construction companies were able to design a system of prefab parts that pop easily on existing properties. A roof covered in solar panels can go directly on top of an old roof, minus tiles. New facades cover the old walls without any demolition. In the backyard, a new cube-shaped energy module holds everything needed for sustainable heat, hot water, power, and ventilation. It just needs to be plugged into the house.\nThe kit makes the retrofits fast enough that they barely disrupt the lives of the people living inside. \"They don\'t have to move out,\" says Linda van Leeuwen, an engineer business developer for BAM Group, one of the construction companies behind the project. \"For example, the same day we remove the window frames we are able to place the complete new front and back facade. We only need 20-40 inches of free space along the window frames inside the house, which means you just have to move your couch or television a little bit.\"\nThe business model is as innovative as the actual design. A government team called Energiesprong realized that renters in the social housing projects were already paying a yearly energy bill of around $2,200. The retrofits eliminate that bill—and by asking tenants to pay the social housing corporations the same amount they would have paid a utility, it completely funds the construction process. Tenants don\'t pay any extra, but they end up with a fully renovated house.\nThe building owners also save money. \"These houses are about 50-60 years old,\" says van Leeuwen. \"Social housing corporations usually refurbish the bathroom, kitchen, and toilet every 15-20 years. Which means most bathrooms, kitchens and toilets need refurbishment anyway. By doing it now we can at the same time integrate new technologies, like ventilation, and new materials like glass that need less maintenance over the years.\"\nThe cost of the retrofits is also quickly dropping. Two years ago, a single townhouse cost about $144,000 to retrofit, and now the cost is around $88,000. The development team is aiming to ultimately reach a cost as low as $45,000, so the retrofits could also be easily affordable for private homeowners.\n\"The costs are coming down because our design and building process became smarter,\" says van Leeuwen. \"The confidence in the market potential of these kind of retrofits contributed also to a lower prices from our suppliers.\"\nIn the next five years, the program plans to retrofit 111,000 houses. It\'s a way for the Netherlands to quickly tackle carbon emissions—the built environment is responsible for a third of all energy use in the country.\nOther countries face a similar challenge. In the U.S., for example, housing accounts for nearly a quarter of energy use, and energy efficiency updates are slow to happen in old homes. Though the Netherlands has the advantage of having millions of similar-looking houses, making it fairly easy to design prefab parts, the developers say that the basic system could work elsewhere. They\'re already planning to export it to the U.K.\n\"I think the systematic approach would work in many different countries, and for many different types of houses,\" van Leeuwen says.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 51

Or are they? Sure, you may adore a Cézanne still-life while your friend absolutely hates it. But research has shown that many people share certain aesthetic preferences, such as landscape paintings and the color blue. Human biology may help explain why.\nA new study out of Yahoo Labs looked at what kind of aesthetics attract people, using a relatively new tool: digital photo filters. The researchers wanted to know whether manipulated images on the web engage people more than unfiltered ones. They assessed 7.6 million photos from Instagram and Flickr, and controlled for variables like the number of followers and how many tags a photo had. The results showed a distinct difference: people are 21% more likely to view filtered photos and 45% more likely to comment on them, compared to regular photos.\nOne reason for this difference might be that filters help tell a story. \"People are adding filters to try and match the narrative that’s in their head at the time when they take the shot,\" says David Ayman Shamma, one of the study authors. Someone might choose a faded, scratched filter for a photo of a favorite old bar, and this old-timey effect supports the viewer’s understanding of the image. If a filter lets our brains process the content of a photo more easily (something called \"perceptual fluency\"), it can make us like the image more.\nFilters may also stir up emotions that draw people to the image. The study authors note this connection—their findings mirror other studies showing that emotional response drives people’s engagement in social media. \"Filters could have an effect on how the viewer feels,\" explains Oshin Vartanian, a psychologist who studies cognitive neuroscience at the University of Toronto Scarborough, and who wasn’t involved in the study. \"And there’s strong evidence for a link between an emotional response and aesthetic preferences.\"\nThe Yahoo Labs study is just the latest addition to centuries of thought on aesthetics—scientific and otherwise. In another (mostly tongue-in-cheek) attempt to identify people’s artistic tastes, two Russian artists surveyed people in 10 countries in the 1990s to find out their \"most wanted\" and \"least wanted\" paintings. The pair polled over 10,000 people in China, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Kenya, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States about their aesthetic preferences by asking questions like \"What’s your favorite color?\" and \"Do you prefer indoor or outdoor scenes?\"\nThe survey results revealed that people across the world generally liked—and disliked—many of the same things in artwork. All 10 countries preferred the color blue, which isn’t a surprise. Studies dating back to the 1940s have shown people presented with a palette of colors typically choose blue as their favorite. The prevalent theory to explain this: People subconsciously associate colors with things of the same color that they’ve seen in the past. So when someone sees the color blue, it reminds them of pleasant blue skies and clear water, and this influences their preference for it. Blue skies and clear water also have a universally positive association, which may explain why so many people across different cultures prefer blue.\nThe survey also found that people generally didn’t like the color yellow, a trend seen in other research. Negative associations probably explain our aversion to yellow: \"Colors are a function of the experiences we’ve had, and speak to our shared environment,\" explains Vartanian. \"People tend to dislike colors in yellow—dark yellow in particular—because it’s typically associated with disease and various undesirable things we’ve come into contact with in the past.\"\nThe 1990s survey also found that most countries (except one) favored landscape paintings. Several decades of research have similarly identified the same preference for open countryside, green grass, trees, water—your standard landscape painting. The popular argument says this Savanna-like landscape speaks to our evolutionary history and basic survival instincts. \"We tend to prefer open environments that allow us to look for resources and watch for predators, as well as the ability to hide from predators (like in a tree),\" Vartanian says. \"If it looks like the kind of environment in which you could survive and thrive, you’re going to have an aesthetic preference for it.\" This mental assessment occurs whether you realize it or not, and whether you’re looking at the actual scene or just a painting of a landscape.\nThe majority of people surveyed for the project also disliked abstract art, and favored curvy lines over sharp, jagged lines—both inclinations likely rooted in how the brain works. Our preference for curvy lines is supported by almost a century of psychological studies, and scientists have found it’s rooted in an evolutionary bias as well. Research has found that when people look at a sharp object in an MRI scanner, it activates a region of the brain (called the amygdala) that responds to danger, whereas curved objects don’t elicit this mental reaction. \"Sharp objects in our past were associated with danger,\" Vartanian says. \"This association has stayed with us, even though the environment we live in today is quite different.\"\nAnd as for abstract art: Well, it’s not hard to figure out why many people don’t like it. An abstract painting is highly conceptual, which means it takes a lot more energy to understand, whereas representational art has a storyline that the viewer can immediately follow. Similar to the photo filters, we typically prefer images that are easier to process. Vartanian notes that this bias doesn’t apply to people trained in visual arts—they tend to like abstract art much more. And there’s a lot of data showing that people with expertise in visual arts perceive paintings very differently overall than someone untrained, so their aesthetic preferences probably differ from the average person in general.\nWhile research has discovered some overarching aesthetic preferences, our artistic tastes will always vary from person to person. \"I think that’s one of the dangers of this research,\" says Bevil Conway, a neuroscientist at Wellesley Collge, \"You don’t want to be like some scientists who say that making great work requires X, Y, and Z, and ‘Here are the 13 things that make a great picture.’\" Because obviously, blue landscapes aren’t everyone’s favorite type of painting—it’s far more complicated than that.\nOoh, behold the Holy Data.  And yet the most successful brands do not necessarily use blue for their logo. And if abstract art gives people headaches, are we supposed to put Smurfs pics all over our pages ? Aesthetics, and art in general IS NOT science by definition. If this were the case, people would have step away from McDonald\'s restaurants, Shell Gas stations and NYC cabs.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 52

The hoverboard incorporates four round engines below the board, creating a magnetic field that lets it hover an inch above a copper surface. The MFA technology works much the same way, but on a bigger scale, Henderson suggested.\n\n\nAccording to Arx Pax’s patent for the three-part foundation, buildings with the system have a \"containment vessel\" that is meant to keep everything above it in place during the lateral movements of an earthquake.\n\n\nHenderson said that the system could be applied to an existing building if its foundation is significantly retrofitted. But he admitted that it would be preferable to include it in all-new construction. He also said that no one has yet integrated Arx Pax’s system in buildings of any kind. \"We’re looking for that forward-thinking partner,\" he said, \"who wants to build more safely.\"\n\n\nThere are current anti-shaking technologies, known as \"base isolation\" systems, that are designed to dramatically slow a building’s movement in an earthquake. But Henderson argued that those systems are expensive and don’t stop the shaking. His method, by contrast, is designed to keep everything exactly in place for about the same cost as base isolation.\n\n\nFor those in earthquake zones, such a technology sounds too good to be true. And since no one has yet incorporated it into a building, it’s hard to say for sure if it would work. But in a release, Arx Pax quoted University of California at Berkeley Seismological Laboratory external relations officer Jennifer Strauss as saying that Arx Pax’s technology, \"combined with the ShakeAlert early-warning system, will allow state-of-the-art seismic protection and vibration control for buildings, operating rooms, highly calibrated instruments, and much more.\"\n\n\nFtCo,\n\n\nPerhaps I\'m not seeing proprietary devices but a suspended building with  a high center of gravity, unequal loading  (a conventional house as shown  having movable furniture can never be balanced),  there are no apparent devices to keep it centered, and with a flat bottom  is likely to capsize easily.   The static design may need reconsideration. \n\n\nAs well, the suspension system is (responsively) static and a  static system can not respond well to a dynamic system. An earthquakes, as they comprise  both wave and field motions that vary in frequency, periodicity, and amplitude is a very dynamic 4D system.  See YouTube videos of the behavior of water in pools during earthquakes and note \"splashing up over the side\".   Wave motion in a contained volume might actually amplify rather than dampen  the forces on the suspended object.\n\n\nThe  basic principle could be made to work, but the devices and system would be quite  different. \n\n\nPoultry Motors and Design\n\n\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 53

You collect each season from the farm, you grade it, and whatever the best grade is, that\'s what you\'ve got and those are the properties you have.\"\nFor decades, researchers have been fascinated by the properties of silk as a material. Spider silk, for example, is famously stronger than steel by weight. But until recently, it\'s been difficult to create an artificial version.\nNow, like Bolt Threads, a number of biotech companies, such as Kraig Biocraft Labs and the Japanese company Spiber, are close to or starting to produce commercial products. They want to use the material to create everything from bulletproof vests to surgical sutures.\n\"Advances in DNA sequencing since the 1990s opened the door to tuned properties, but there were many pieces of the puzzle that had to be solved in order to do it consistently, at scale, and at a cost that made it commercially viable,\" says Widmaier.\nThe startup uses yeast engineered to make silk protein, and grows it in fermenters similar to what you\'d find in a brewery making beer. After purifying the protein away from the yeast, they spin it using a process similar to making rayon or nylon. The result is engineered silk.\nIt can look and feel exactly like fabric made using silkworms—but it can also be better, both because it can avoid the unpredictability of the natural production process, and because the proteins can be engineered to have whatever qualities an apparel company wants.\n\"Silk today is a fiber that\'s the ultimate luxury fiber, it\'s soft, it\'s strong, it drapes really well, it\'s got a great luster to it, and that\'s great,\" says Widmaier. \"But it\'s also fragile and doesn\'t care for well, it yellows over time, and there\'s all these things that are wrong with it as well. That\'s the give and take of natural fibers.\"\nThe company\'s new line of performance fabrics may also eventually start to replace petroleum-based materials like nylon. \"There\'s room to make both higher-performing and more sustainable fibers,\" he says. \"The beauty of making a protein-based fiber is you get sustainability in the form of it\'s grown from nature and can be recycled by nature.\"\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 54

Loads of research says that daylight, plants, and even pictures of the outdoors can help people get more done. But the newest co-working space in London goes a little farther: It\'s actually outside, in a tree. And every time you pay rent, the tree takes the proceeds.\n\"As a place to work, I can\'t think of a better office,\" says artist, engineer, and New York University professor Natalie Jeremijenko, who designed TreeXOffice in an East London park called Hoxton Square. \"It\'s a beautiful, airy, delicious space in amongst the chaos of public space.\"\nSix to eight people can work in the tree at any given time, using the tree\'s new Wi-Fi and power supply. And while it\'s arguably a better workspace for freelancers than the typical office in a high-rise, the art project is equally beneficial for the park. Legally, the tree acts as the landlord, and all of the membership fees will be reinvested to make the tree and its surroundings healthier.\n\"The profits from the tree are spent in the interest of the tree,\" says Jeremijenko. \"By making it specifically about the tree, and the kind of revenue that the tree can generate, we\'re really exploring a larger political discussion of what are the rights of nature.\"\nThe usual way of calculating the value of a tree is to add up its environmental \"services,\" such as improving air quality, sequestering carbon, and saving energy in buildings by offering shade. But by this kind of pencil pusher calculation the resulting numbers are actually fairly low. In New York City, for example, a tree is valued at $400 for 80 years of service.\n\"They\'re very low-paid service workers,\" says Jeremijenko. \"And that isn\'t consistent with my sense of value. That doesn\'t sound right.\" When she created a similar temporary coworking \"tree office\" in New York a few years ago, 25 people each paid $40 membership fees, so the tree was suddenly generating $1,000 a month.\n\"That\'s a significant difference,\" she says. \"Positioning the tree as landlord is really to debate how do we constitute value.\"\nIn the project in New York, the profits were spent partly on augmenting the soil around the tree, and \"sending three saplings off to college\"—planting the tree\'s offshoots at NYU and Columbia. In a similar way, the project in London will directly benefit the host tree.\nJeremijenko sees the project as a translation of the Rights of Nature movement, which argues that ecosystems should have legal rights. The Bolivian ambassador plans to stop by the tree office to talk about his own country\'s historic law that gives nature equal rights as humans.\n\"The real work is making these connections,\" Jeremijenko says. \"How do we work together, and what kind of mutualistic relationships do we construct, in order to produce a desirable future?\"\n\"It\'s the grand challenge of the century—redesigning our relationship to natural systems,\" she says. \"The Tree Office is exploring that.\"\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 55

Now add video-game director to his credits. In the past year, Lee both co-wrote and directed the \"My Player\" storyline of the upcoming NBA2K16—what\'s historically been an amusing but meaningless game where you create an NBA player, and over the course of several basketball seasons, become a superstar in your own right. Can Lee, who joins Steven Spielberg and Guillermo del Toro as the latest elite director to try a hand at video games, make it great?\nI met up with Lee in May, shortly after controversy erupted around the film he’s currently shooting in Chicago, Chiraq. Here, he talks about everything from creative censorship to directing video games to the inevitable future of virtual reality movies.\nCo.Design: Your production company shoots commercials and creative films. Which is NBA2K16? Is this a commercial entity or creative entity?\nSpike Lee: It’s both. I mean, Do the Right Thing was a commercial entity. It’s a studio film. You’re not doing it for charity. They’re not going to give me that. Here’s the thing though, for me, I’ve been able to be very successful navigating the whole thing between commerce and art. And I would say that this venture with 2K16 is the same thing.\nIs there a difference in autonomy in some of these projects?\n Everything’s different. I wouldn’t say it’s a one note thing. My last film, I raised the money on Kickstarter, it’s all different.\nLook at what happened with Chiraq—Mayor Rahm Emanuel asked you to change the title of the film, as part of a campaign that claims it stigmatizes our dangerous South Side, which I think is censorship, but the city gave you millions in tax incentives so they might feel like they own a piece of it. But if a client like the video game company 2K asks you to change an element of the story, I assume you would?\n It depends. There’s a whole give and take with film. Hopefully most of the time you work out the issues for film and then what happens almost all the time, you get notes from the studio, some you agree with, some you don’t. But this, I’m very pleased with. I don’t think they had any notes.\nI’ve played a lot of 2K games, and My Career is generally the same story over and over. I play as some basketball player who looks a lot like me, and I play a lot of basketball games, and I make my way up the ranks to be a superstar.\n Well, if it was the same story, you wouldn’t be here right now. They brought me in for a reason: they want something new. They really wanted to expand on a narrative aspect of it. And I do storytelling. That’s why they came to me.\nIs it a story that can make someone respond strongly, emotionally? Will people cry playing this video game?\n It depends on the type of heart a person has playing the game! It’s very dramatic. Very emotional.\nHow is telling a story different in a game than in films?\n No difference. We don’t see a difference. Our approach is we’re making a piece of cinema, a feature film, even though we knew it’d end up in NBA2K.\nYou don’t worry about the filmic elements translating to a game?\n We’re making a movie. That was the approach.\nSo you see the storytelling aspect of it transcending the medium.\n Any medium. That’s why I can tell stories in 30-second commercials.\nI see your public persona in two pieces. One, a guy who sits courtside at a lot of NBA games, and two, the side of you who shoots socially conscious films that irk society in a positive way.\n I don’t know how one doesn’t do with the other. I could be a filmmaker and my interests could be opera. You know, we’re human beings, so hopefully, to be a well-rounded individual—some people it’s film film film film film, but that’s not my only interest. And sports—filmmaking came to me late. When my father introduced me to sports, I was 5, 6, 7 years old. It’s something that’s been a passion of mine much longer than being a filmmaker.\nIt’s not strange to you that there’s everything happening with the Chiraq controversy, and we’re here talking about basketball?\n No because I have more than one interest, so I do more than one thing at one time. It’s not just like, I did the My Career thing and nothing else is going to happen. Stuff is on top of each other.\nDo you need that? Would it be too serious if you were doing mostly serious films?\n I, sir, think you need to go to IMDb and look at my body of work. This is not 1986. Everything isn’t Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X. Kings of Comedy and Inside Man—that’s a pure bank heist drama.\nDo the Right Thing and Malcolm X obscure a lot of my interests. And so people just think that’s, you know, all of my life is based upon racism, stuff like that.\nSure, your career has obviously evolved. \n For me, I understand your question, I don’t see a contradiction that I’m here in Chicago working on a film, and I’m doing an interview for something that’s coming out in October. I have several major interests so I’m working all the time. I have many projects, and you have to talk, do press work before stuff comes out. This is why you’re here! Originally, I’d be doing this press in New York. I’m not in New York! I’m here in Chicago.\nI look at your Kobe Bryant documentary, and that’s total cinéma vérité. It\'s just a day in his life. But I feel like it’s not critical. It just paints Kobe as a hard-working guy. Can you bring a critical lens to sports?\n We did that. We brought a very critical lens to college basketball with He Got Game. We showed how dirty it is.\nCan you do that in a video game?\n That’s not the purpose, really. I mean, we do touch upon some stuff, but it\'s different—there was no agenda in this, just tell a good story. He Got Game went into an indictment of college sports. Such a big business, and how NCAA takes advantage of the student athlete.\nI feel like you can\'t make a game about basketball right now because the sport isn’t in a critical place. I feel like if you were to make a game about NFL, and you were to tell a narrative, you’d have to talk about a lot of the other stuff.\n Yeah, nobody’s beating their wife in this. There’s none of that marital abuse, spouse abuse. There’s no need for that in this.\nHow do you get involved day-to-day on a game? What’s your logistical involvement look like. Do you direct it as you do a film?\n My man, as I said before, I’m a director, so nothing was different in my approach to this than any of the other stuff I did. The technologies were different. Because we\'re shooting on a motion-capture stage where there are very few props, the actors were in costumes, with suits with balls on it. A lot of stuff you have to visualize and it’s put in post-production. But other than that, I’m doing what I do when I’m doing commercials—the stuff a director has to do was no different in this.\nA lot of filmmakers have said, with the interactive medium, it’s a bad place to tell traditional narrative stories, because the player wants to be his or her own director.\n I don’t see it like that. For me, I knew that one of the things that a game is like is, they do have the option [to sometimes change camera angles]? I’m okay with that. I mean, I’ve seen stuff where DVDs come out and have alternate endings. Same thing.\nFast forward 20 to 30 years, how do you imagine film and interactive media evolving?\n I don’t know what’s going to happen. I have no idea what’s going to happen. I really can’t look in the future like that. But there’s going to be some stuff that nobody’s thought about. Maybe one person’s thought about.\nIs your skillset as a director going to need to change? \n I can’t answer that. I don’t have a crystal ball. It’s going be amazing, though. I mean, we all know what’s going to come. It’s going to be where you put something on your head, put some wires on your head and your wrists, and you leave your body and are able to interact in this world. That’s what everybody wants, full immersion in a different world. We’ve seen films like that, where you’re in a film and you’re in it.\nYou haven’t directed one of those films.\n Not yet! It wasn’t Do The Right Thing, that’s for sure.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 56

With increasing security requirements, it’s likely your word/number combinations are becoming even less memorable. But new research suggests it may not be long before you won’t need to memorize passwords.\n\n\n\"Brainprint,\" a  published in Neurocomputing, reveals that the brain’s reaction to certain words could be a unique identifying code—like a fingerprint—that could eventually replace passwords.\n\n\nIn a small experiment, the researchers hooked up an EEG to the scalps of 45 volunteers and measured their brains’ signals as they read through a list of 75 acronyms that included FBI and DVD. The word-recognition response differed so much between each participant that a second experiment using a computer program could identify each one with 94% accuracy.\n\n\nIt\'s not enough to feel totally secure, but promising enough to hint at the future of securing sensitive information. Especially given that monitoring brain activity as a means of verifying identity has been tested since 2007.\n\n\nThe advantage of using such a biometric system is that it can be used for continuous verification, New Scientist points out.\n\n\nPasswords or fingerprints only provide a tool for one-off identification. Continuous verification—by face or ear recognition, or perhaps by monitoring brain activity—could in theory allow someone to interact with many computer systems simultaneously, or even with a variety of intelligent objects, without having to repeatedly enter passwords for each device.\n\n\nAs Hollywood has illustrated, it’s simply a matter of cutting off a finger to appropriate that person’s identity. \"Brainprints, on the other hand, are potentially cancellable,\" said Sarah Laszlo, assistant professor of psychology and linguistics at Binghamton University and co-author of the study, \"So, in the unlikely event that attackers were actually able to steal a brainprint from an authorized user, the authorized user could then \'reset\' their brainprint.\"\n\n\nUntil now, brain signals have been a challenge to parse. This experiment leaped over the hurdle by focusing on the brainwaves from the specific area that reads and recognizes words. The signal is therefore clearer and easier to measure.\n\n\nThe drawback, so far, is that the brain signal is still not as accurate as scanning someone’s iris or fingerprint, and initially requires sticking diodes on your head in order to get a read. That’s ok, according to Zhanpeng Jin, assistant professor at Binghamton University and coauthor of the study, because brainprint isn’t going to be mass-produced any time soon. He says the researchers envision its use at places such as the Pentagon, where the number of authorized users is small, and they don’t need to be continuously verified the way you do to access your mobile device or email.\n\n\nBetter keep your memory sharp, at least a little while longer.\n\n\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 57

The result will affect the entire Marvel Comics line: 55 to 60 new titles will begin at issue No. 1, rolled out over a period of several months. The stories will begin eight months in narrative time after the end of Secret Wars, meaning that within those eight off-page months, things will have happened in characters\' lives to set the stage moving forward. For example, \"It could be that they live in a new place or that someone near and dear to them has died, or they\'re even married or pregnant,\" says Marvel editor-in-chief, Axel Alonso.\n\n\n\"Comics publishing is slowly evolving into more of a seasonal model,\" says Alonso. \"We\'re allowed to hit a refresh button—not a reboot button, but a refresh button—which allows for the beginning of new stories, new creative teams, new directions, much the same way you see with your favorite binge-worthy cable-television show.\" While no specific titles or creative teams have been announced, the new line will feature popular writers including Brian Michael Bendis, Jason Aaron, Mark Waid, Dan Slott, Charles Soule, G. Willow Wilson, and Jeff Lemire.\n\n\nOne element that draws readers to the comics of the largest two publishers, Marvel and DC, are their expansive shared universes—dozens of series and stories are overlapping and taking place at once, so making those connections is fun and challenging. From an editorial standpoint, this approach makes for a rich storytelling toolbox—but it can also get unwieldy, and every few years, the Big Two tend to stage line-wide \"events,\" usually cataclysmic in nature, that reset the narrative universes (DC is in the middle of its own recalibration, which is called Convergence).\n\n\nIn the case of Secret Wars, multiple Marvel parallel realities have met on one planet, known as Battleworld. While the series is still in its early stages, a known result will be the end of Ultimate Marvel, a popular imprint that has been home to alternate character story lines for 15 years. While this will undoubtedly be disappointing to longtime fans of the Ultimate universe, Alonso says that some of those Ultimate characters will continue in the main continuity, giving Marvel \"an incredible, wide array of options to spice up our universe.\"\n\n\nFor example, the most recent Spider-Man in the Ultimate universe is Miles Morales, a teenager of black and Hispanic descent who became extremely popular with readers. Alonso says he would rather \"leave to speculation\" whether Morales will join the new Marvel universe, but also says, \"to see a character like Miles Morales in the Marvel universe would be, I think, a seismic event.\" Marvel\'s All-New All-Different promotional art, above, also strongly suggests his presence in the form of the smaller, black-costumed Spider-Man in the upper right.\n\n\nOther hints one can glean from the fresh art: the new Marvel Universe will feature three popular, recently introduced female characters—Muslim teenager Kamala Khan, aka Ms. Marvel; Spider-Gwen (Peter Parker\'s girlfriend Gwen Stacy from an alternate universe in which she is bitten by the radioactive spider instead of Peter); and the new Thor, whose title has been outselling previous series starring her male predecessor. It also seems likely that the now-female Captain Marvel, aka Carol Danvers, will play an important role in the new Marvel as a character who has inspired a powerful grassroots fan movement. Marvel\'s newer female-led comics have been huge sales winners for the company overall—while the first issues of big \"event\" comics usually sell around 100,000 copies, according to figures released by Diamond Comic Distributors, Spider-Gwen #1 and Thor #1 sold 250,000 and 200,000 respectively, and Ms. Marvel #1 went into seven printings and was the best-selling digital comic for Marvel in 2014.\n\n\nAlonso also says that the latest line will introduce a new Hulk \"like you\'ve never seen him before,\" and hints that this Hulk will not be Bruce Banner, although Banner will still exist.\n\n\nCharacter shake-ups—particularly when women and minorities take up the mantles of heroes long known as white males—tend to kick up heavy debate among the comic world\'s notoriously hardcore fans. \"We\'re aware that there are going to be old-school, long-term fans who might bristle,\" says Alonso. \"There will always be those that didn\'t enjoy it, and they\'ll let you know about it, but ultimately the market tells you if your instincts are right. If we had blinked at the first piece of mail about a female Thor, or African-American Captain America, or Pakistani-American Miss Marvel, if we\'d second-guessed ourselves based on that mail, none of those things would have happened. And if we lost one or two fans, we gained eight in return.\"\n\n\nIn a move that should anger exactly zero fans, Alonso also tells Fast Company that fan-favorite character Wolverine \"will return to the Marvel Universe,\" though he won\'t say how that will play out. This is significant not only because the virtually immortal mutant died in a story line last year, but because it suggests that the X-Men will have a place in the new world order. While the X-Men have been one of Marvel\'s most popular and best-selling teams for decades, there has been speculation that both they and the Fantastic Four are being pushed out of the comic books for the time being because Marvel Studios doesn\'t own the film rights (they\'re owned by 20th Century Fox, who distributed last year\'s Days of Future Past and will distribute the upcoming Fantastic Four movie). The X-Men and the Fantastic Four are the only Marvel properties to which Marvel doesn\'t own the film rights, after a deal with Sony earlier this year that would enable Marvel to use Spider-Man in its films (Sony had held his film rights since 1999). While many fans have been unhappy with the idea that the X-Men and Fantastic Four could be scaled back in the comics, it makes sense that Marvel would devote more page space to characters that they can exploit in movies, and less to those that benefit other studios. Beyond Wolverine, Marvel wouldn\'t comment for now on the teams\' status in the new comic-book universe.\n\n\nThere\'s no question that simplifying and starting new stories from the beginning could make the comic books more attractive to fans of the movies; the ongoing, complex nature of comics universes often means that picking one up on a whim is an exercise in confusion and frustration. But Alonso says that he is under no pressure to align the comics content-wise with the films.\n\n\n\"When Avengers: Age of Ultron came out, we had a female Thor and a Superior Iron Man [evil version of Tony Stark] and an African-American Captain America,\" says Alonso. \"The great thing about the movies is that they\'ve created a world for us now in publishing where everyone knows who Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow are, right? Everybody knows.\"\n\n\nAnd now Marvel hopes everyone will want to know even more.\n\n\n\"who distributed both last year\'s Days of Future Past and the upcoming Fantastic Four movie\" How has fox distributed an upcoming movie? \n\n\nfixed, thanks!\n\n\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 58

The company is working with partners to bring cheaper devices to the market, and part of this plan is Windows 10 with Bing, a special version of the new operating system that would only be addressed to original equipment manufacturers. This low-price basic version of Windows comes with hardcoded Bing branding, although the search engine can be changed by the user. Microsoft wants Windows 10 to be installed on as many devices as possible, and the company\'s roadmap expects 1 billion PCs, tablets, and smartphones to be running it until 2017. The build for Raspberry Pi 2 is still in the works as well. 	  	\nAnd, you know, this isn\'t exactly big new news...\nMicrosoft is coming to the party late, as usual, with their \"me too\" product.\nI think for Microsoft to be saying they \"expect\" 1 billion devices by 2017 is going to prove to be way too damned optimistic.\nSure, this is the exact same thing as Google does with Android.  But will anybody give a damn is the question.\nEven from reading TFA, I\'m not sure I understand.. I take it that that version of Windows 10 comes with Bing hardcoded, but only for Internet Explorer (or whatever it is that they\'re calling the Windows 10 replacement)? I presume there\'s still nothing stopping users, once they get it, from installing Chrome or Firefox, and choosing whatever search engine they want?\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 59[0m

Go to the lumber store and you can get a 2x4, and they are sold in 6, 8, 10, and 12 foot lengths. Plywood is sold in 4x4 foot sheets.  Just about everybody I know refers to their weight in pounds and their height in feet and inches.  Almost nobody can tell you the metric equivalent without a calculator.  We order a pint of beer at the pub, and most people still refer to a block of butter as a \"pound of butter\". . British people still use \"stone\" to express their body weight, and they are supposed to be metric as well.\nYou can standardize all you want, and print whatever you want on the packaging, but people are still going to use whatever they are used to.  You could have the US go metric tomorrow, but people will still use Imperial measurements for another century\n2x4s, of course, aren\'t 2\" by 4\". They\'re approximately 1,5 by 3,5 inches. As for lengths, here in Iceland it\'s sold in meters. We refer to our weights in kilograms and our heights in centimeters. Butter is sold in 500 gram bars. Cans and bottles of beer are in millilitres; I don\'t know what they call the size of a glass at a pub because I don\'t drink.  Anyway, it\'s really hard to think of things we use imperial units on. The one that comes to mind is TVs, they\'re in inches.  I\'m sure there\'s others - they \nThe US is already metric. It was the second country after France to adopt the metric system in the 19th century. All our standard units are defined in metric units. the thing is, it just doesn\'t force people or industry it doesn\'t deal with to use it. About the only thing they could do is post signs in metric, which they have already attempted several times, and the experiments pretty much failed. Currently this in the US not using the metric system aren\'t because there is no reason to and for those who are \nAnd that\'s what hobbles US products in the rest of the world. It doesn\'t fit together with your other stuff, and you need special imperial size tools to work with it. It\'s bad enough with wire, where you have AWG and metric sizes and thus need two sets of strippers (my teeth are only calibrated for metric).\nLet\'s be honest here, going metric is just like banning guns: regardless of how you feel about the subject, the cost of changing the way it has been for hundreds of years is just too great. From road signs to revamping of labels to changing all hardware (like tools/bolts/etc) to just changing how people think about measurements.\nThat\'s it.\nHowever in the US, we\'re familiar with the current system so it isn\'t a big deal... and the US has never really cared what was standard in other countries. We just don\'t care.\nFirst, most people just ignored it and used the existing imperial system.\nSecond, it was the middle of a bad economic time and transitioning costs money because you have to change everything to suit the new system. It was just a tough sell in hard times.\nThird... and this can\'t be stressed enough... I feel like the metric advocates really don\'t get this... Americans don\'t care about joining a global standard. At all. Not even a little.\nWhen you factor it out, what you\'re left with is advantage of their divisible by ten units versus the more varied divisions in imperial.\nThat\'s pretty much it. And then you have to factor that Americans know imperial so it isn\'t a hardship to use it. And they don\'t know metric as well so it is inconvenient.\nAmerica has long counted on just being America, but those days are ending. Not only are sales of American cars slipping in China, for example, but we\'re about to get our first Chinese car here in the USA. The American automobile has already long since gone full-metric (except those things which have somehow remained stubbornly SAE, like spark plugs and most drain plugs, which still have square SAE holes in them) and it was only in part because the foreign parts are in metric; it\'s also because the foreign m \nA liberal Republican, Chafee was frequently ranked as the least conservative Senate Republican, and to the left of some conservative Democrats.

The first three games that will ship using the technology are  Yummy Circus ,  Defender\'s Quest (HD edition) , and the award-winning  Papers, Please.  Haxe is a programming language that compiles to other programming languages (everything from C++ to Javascript to Python), has been around for about 10 years and is quite powerful. OpenFL is a hardware-accelerated cross-platform reimplementation of the Flash API, built on top of Haxe (but does not have the Flash player\'s performance and security limitations and has nothing to do with Adobe), and is built on a low-level cross-platform layer called Lime, which can be used separately for those who have no need for a Flash-like API. This could eventually lead to console compatibility for engines that are built on top of Haxe/OpenFL, such as Away3D, Stencyl, HaxeFlixel, and HaxePunk. \n Six console targets are planned: WiiU, PS4, XBox One, PSVita, 3DS, and PS3; footage of demos running on the WiiU was presented at the talk and are included in the linked article. 	  	\nSo is this basically a framework that allows people to port all their Flash games to the console?  Because at the end of the day, that\'s what it sounds like.\nAdding another layer of abstraction means adding another layer of non-optimization in the coding process.  For desktop apps, that\'s not too big an issue; but consoles have a longer upgrade cycle and a restricted memory footprint.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 61[0m

Yes, Siri can give you a list of Italian restaurants in the area, Cortana will happily look up the weather, and Google Now will send a text message, if you ask it to. But compared to Hound, the newest voice search app on the block, all three of the aforementioned assistants might as well be bumbling idiots trying to outwit a fast talking rocket scientist. At its core, Hound is the same type of app — you bark commands or ask questions about any number of topics and it responds intelligently. And quickly. What\'s different about Hound compared to Siri, Cortana, and Google Now is that it\'s freakishly fast and understands complex queries that would have the others hunched in the fetal position, thumb in mouth. Check out the demo. It\'s pretty impressive. 	  	\nI take it you don\'t know what a homophone is so you relied on some website to check for you?\nBecause if you actually read what GP wrote you might notice that \"waze\" (which is not a dictionary word) sounds identical to \"ways\" (which is a dictionary word). Depending, of course, on how you pronounce ways. But a native English speaker (are you?) is almost certainly going to pronounce \"waze\" identically to \"ways\".\nThe e at the end of a word like that (one consonant between it and a vowel) makes the vowel say its name. The z / s sound essentially the same in was/waze/ways, though perhaps in some areas ways has a softer s, the a is very different in was to waze. Think daze with a w instead of d.\nHoly crap the video is impressive.  It clearly parses phrased and dependent logical statements like \" what is the population of the capitol of the country in which the space needle is located. \"  It alos parsed paragraph long multi-part questions.  I was floored.\nAs for homophones, how do you (human) recognize them.  Well you parse the logical context.  If you are doing single word dictation homophones will always be a problem but for queries there\'s context.  And the demo shows this thing can handle some staggering conditional contexts and long phrases.  So I would  guess that if your query is not ambiguous in the use of the word Waze, then this thing is approachi8ng a level where it will indeed get the right homophone.\nThe challenge is the non-standard homophones. As the smart-ass AC showed, Waze is not a typically recognized homophone (of anything) because it\'s not a word. Recognition works great with core speech, but anything specialized usually gets mangled. Try \"what is the size of a double you twelve by fifty-three.\"  The answer is, of course, is 12 inches by 10 inches. It may be one of the most common sections used in building construction. I\'m not sure it would help even if you prefaced it with an \"ay eye ess sea\" \nI tried sending a text with Google\'s voice engine last week just to try it out.  It did a very good job of taking my dictation to text, then it asked if I wanted to send.  I said yes.  It spelled out yes in it\'s little window, then asked again, I said yes again, I tried other words, it also recognized those words, and every time asked me if I wanted to send, while recognizing the words.  I finally reached over and hit the send button.\nI tried replying to a work text with something like \"It\'s okay to use a W12x14 in place of the C section. Just make sure that it\'s AISC A992 grade 50\" What came out was unusable, while \"yo, bitch, put the dinner on the table I\'ll be home in 5\" was transcribed verbatim. Thank goodness I had the same problem with voice send or I would have been picking up McDonalds on my way to sleep with the dog.\nThe only thing MojoKid (1002251) wrote for this submission was \"Check out the demo. It\'s pretty impressive,\" while the rest was plagiarized from the \"Hothardware\" article written by Paul Lilly, who does seems to be breathlessly impressed by an internal demo of an unreviewed application.\nI\'m going to call this a formatting error and a sad omission of credit, because I refuse to believe that someone would shamelessly lift words that they hadn\'t written and posit them as their own.  Maybe it\'s the editors\' fault.  In either case, it\'s sloppy posting and comes off as skeezy no matter what the excuse might be.\nThe nested (\"capital of the country in which the space needle...\") and serialized (??? and ???) queries are somewhat impressive and a good next step in AI. But to really be impressive, it needs to go further. For example, when he asked about the mortgage payment, it should have volunteered the information that the mortgage payment it calculated was principal an interest only, but that you\'d typically also have to pay escrow for taxes and insurance. And it should have estimated a value for those based on cur \n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 62[0m

Wikileaks\' release of 17 documents from the negotiating countries puts some bad light on some of the provisions being considered: From the Forbes report: Under the draft provisions of the latest trade deal to be leaked by Wikileaks, countries could be barred from trying to control where their citizens\' personal data is held or whether it\'s accessible from outside the country.  ... These negotiating texts are supposed to remain secret for five years after TISA is finalized and brought into force. Like TTIP and TPP, TISA could be sped through Congress using Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), also known as fast-track authority, which has been passed by the US Senate and may be taken up in the House this month. Under TPA, Congress is barred from making amendments to the trade deals, and most simply give yes-or-no approval. 	  	\nBut even that\'s making the assumption there was ever some innocence to be corrupted, which could perhaps be restored. In reality, while money\'s certainly changed hands it\'s mostly just a matter people liking those similar to themselves. A CEO and a senator understand each other since they both pursue and wield power. They\'re part of the ruling class. Even if they were both full of honest, incorruptible pure pureness and good will towards man, they\'d still have much more in common with one another than with Joe Average.\nThis is true everywhere. Of course the bigger the pyramid of power the farther the top is from the bottom, so it shows up especially badly at EU and US federal level. However, Joe Average looks down on Joe Unemployed with exactly similar attitude his betters look at him. It\'s the hierarchy itself that needs to go. Democracy was a good start, but as this very article demonstrates, it\'s not sufficient. It makes the pyramid lower, but it\'s still there. I imagine the next step would need to be to guarantee economic independence for everyone; we\'ll likely have to resort to citizen pay anyway to keep the economy from crumbling as automation eliminates jobs, and money is the single greatest manifestation of inequality of power in all Western societies, so it makes a good next target.\nWell, the US has divided its authority into houses to maintain a balance of powers, so that no single authority can dominate the decision making process.\nThe executive is charged with being the head of state, namely a single person to negotiate treaties. The senate, or the \"upper\"/\"elder\" house, must ratify those treaties before they become law.\nThe congress, the \"lower\" or \"junior\" house, was meant to deal with day-to-day issues of the younger folk, those with a future.\nIn general it was originally decided that any two of the congress, senate, and executive are needed to make a law.\nThe judicial branch is intended to resolve disputes based on judicial principles. Except where there is a legal vacuum they cannot create law (\"stare decisis\" / \"ratio decidendi\").\nThe EU has similar rules.  Data cannot leave or be processed outside the country without SOMEONE in the EU taking the fall for allowing it to happen should something go wrong.\nEU data protection is pretty hard.  Google, Microsoft etc. provide guarantees to EU governments that school data on their apps (e.g. Google Apps for Education/Government etc.) are never stored nor transmitted to non-EU datacentres.  I know, because as part of my job, I have a legal duty to check that this is the case of any company I hand our pupil\'s data off to.\nJust because we don\'t want US noses in our data doesn\'t mean we\'re being malicious.  It just means we have a set of rules and if you\'re not prepared to follow those rules, you can\'t have our data.  Rules like \"We have a right to see the data stored on ourselves\", \"We have the right to correct that information if it\'s incorrect\", \"We have a right to know what\'s happening to our data and who processes it and for what purpose\" and so on.\nThere\'s a reason that I cannot allow use of Apple iCloud on-site.  Apple refuse to provide such guarantees.  Therefore their cloud service is dead to us (for many other reasons as well, but that\'s just Apple).  There\'s a reason that I cannot use a software supplier from Sri Lanka who wants our business - because they can\'t provide the correct guarantees of our data and thus I personally, can be held *LEGALLY* liable if they take our data and some of it leaks out (for the purposes of the EU data protection laws, leak of any personally-identifiable information can result in fines and prosecution with personal liability - personally-identifiable information might be, say, one name with, say, one date-of-birth.  Game over).\nSorry, but there\'s a reason that Dropbox, Twitter, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and everyone else has an Irish datacenter - they have to control and process UK and EU user\'s data within the EU, according to strict laws, or risk enormous fines.  The US divisions \"demanding\" access to the EU data is the impetus of the last year to separate the companies geographically so they can legally comply with EU regulations and not have to give data to the overbearing demands of the US court system that has no such jurisdiction.\nWe protect our data.  Just because you don\'t, that doesn\'t make us terrorists or police states.  In fact, it skews towards the exact opposite.\nUnder the draft provisions of the latest trade deal to be leaked by Wikileaks, countries could be barred from trying to control where their citizens\' personal data is held or whether it\'s accessible from outside the country....

Turns out, Baidu gamed the system, creating 30 accounts and running far more than the 2 tests per week allowed in the contest. Having been caught cheating, Baidu has been banned for a year from the challenge.  I believe all competitors are using variations on the convolutional neural network, AKA deep  network.  Running the test dozens of times per week might allow a competitor to pre-tune parameters for the particular problem, thus producing results that might not generalize to other problems.  All of which makes it quite ironic that a Baidu scientist crowed \"Our company is now leading the race in computer intelligence!\" 	  	\nI\'m not surprised, but not for the reason I suspect you have in mind: \"Because Chinese are just so and so...\".\nHowever, it does not really surprise me that we see this from some Chinese companies. China is a developing nation, and they are still relatively new to the way companies play it in the West - not that we are in fact more honest in the West, we have just learned how and when to be dishonest in a way that doesn\'t make as much noise. I mean, just think of large corporations that avoid paying tax or buy cheaply from sweat-shops employing child-labour. There is no shortage of examples.\nBut there is another thing in it: lack of regulation. It should not be a surprise to anyone that when there is too little regulation, the most ruthless will feel entitled to bully others - the free, unregulated market can never work to the benefit of everybody, because there will always some, that ruthlessly go for maximising their own short-term advantage, and and that behaviour pushes out the competition and creates monopolies. It is perhaps ironical that this argument is exactly analogous with the argument against Communism: \"people are selfish, so if they don\'t have a reason to work harder, most won\'t\".\nWe see this in all developing countries, but perhaps most tragilcally in Russia, where they tried to go from tightly regulated Communism to a kind of laissez-faire Capitalism overnight and got horribly burned. And they ended up with the same kind of masters as before, because scum always rises to the top of the pond.\nAll companies have these kind of skeletons in the closet. Chinese companies simply seem to have some more on top of those which everyone else lovingly owns.\nLack of regulation might be a reason when seeing this internally (within the country) - and then again, when all else is equal... But here we\'re talking about international events, and that\'s where you see companies A, B, C playing by the rules and company D (Chinese, more often than not) trying to cheat its way in.\nNo more than a couple weeks ago there was a story here on/. about Chinese students taking exams instead of the ones who should. After many, many, MANY such stories over the years one can\'t help but develop a stereotype.\nFrom fake $ITEM to cheating in competitions, China seems on top of the world as count of occurrences.\nI googled \"chinese cheating\": got 22.6M results, top results are about exam cheating.\nI also googled \"americans cheating\", got 14.8M results, top results are about marital cheating.\nOf course, this might not mean much, but it\'s a start. Anyone wants to send a research grant my way?:)\nThis reminds me of some Chinese ball screws (rotary to linear motion components) my company once ordered from Alibaba. The companies had pictures, drawings and put together quotes for parts but then delivered samples that were just totally totally useless. Some of these \'precision\' parts looked like they had been made with a file. It just didn\'t make any sense that they would waste their and our time on such clearly incompetent products.\nBut when you go there you realise the problem. It is basically an economy in a state of hyper competition. There is so much competition that people will just try anything get ahead, completely oblivious to the wider problem or goal they are trying to solve.  You can see that in how the government had to rationalise the solar industry because nobody could make any money. They are just really really crazy competitive.\nThe trouble though is that there are now many good Chinese engineers who know what they are doing but are still hyper competitive. I really don\'t know how us westerners with our 40hr work weeks, healthcare and pensions are going to eventually compete with that until we too are faced with the desperation of trying to escape from abject poverty along with 1 billion other people.\nYou need the buyers to stand up to that kind of crap.  These guys screwed (sorry) you once, black list them. I had a frustrated guy in procurement say \"You could make tons of money in x business by just doing what you say you are going to do.\"  When it came down to it, he was not always allowed to make the smart decision and go with a reliable company\'s bid if it wasn\'t close to the bottom.\n  Part of the problem we see in China is that they spawn new companies like rabbits.  One will eventually go under doing shady stuff only for the same people to come back, selling the exact same crap under a different name.  We had this happen and you could look at the product and see that they were using the exact same molds, same defects.\nThis is not \"racism\" — ex-Soviets like myself often have the same problem... A cheating Western student fears (or used to fear) the shame of being exposed. A Chinese — or a Soviet — fears merely getting caught. Like a speeding ticket — there is no shame in driving fast, only in being stopped by \"the bear\". \n China today uses drones to catch cheaters [engadget.com] — America had not felt the need for such measures. Perhaps, it was a foolish attitude, because we the immigrants bring all our traits [slashdot.org] to the \"wonderful tapestry of diversity\", not just the good ones... \nIn situations in which it\'s a liability to be honest, only suckers are honest.\nAnd in governments who have spend decades saying \"there is no higher power than the state\", if the state is rampantly corrupt, \"integrity\" is a relative term.\nGive it a few more years, and you\'ll discover that integrity in America is a much more malleable concept than you realize -- in fact, it\'s probably already there.\nYes, well.. Truth be told, cheating and being dishonest are usually not long term strategies for success under any system. You cheat in school?  You will pay later when the next course comes along that uses the material you don\'t know.  Cheat again and you just increase your chances of getting caught.  One cheat leads to another, then more, usually bigger and bigger ones until you get caught and pay the piper for cheating.\nChina is a fast-moving, up-and-comer nation in the modern sense, but they lead the way in air pollution. Some mock our nation\'s EPA, but you can thank them, and other local entities like them, who put air and water quality above corporate profits, despite the many complaints from the largest abusers and other overly friendly corporate shills and lackeys. Allowing businesses to run amok in the name of a few low-paying jobs and letting them skip out on paying a fair share in taxes is how these things happen. \nSo, while they deserve the year ban, the apology is nice.  It\'s a shame we can never know what results a fair competition could have yielded... and an even bigger shame that the media misreported Baidu as overpowering Google.  I suppose the damage is done and the ILSVRC has made the right choice.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 65[0m

The information has also been confirmed by Greg Kroah-Hartman, a renowned kernel developer who is currently maintaining several kernel branches, including a few LTS ones. When Linux kernel 4.1 is released, it will become the LTS version of 2015 and the most advanced long-term support release.  This is significant because the LTSI releases are (or will be) everywhere, in a \"Linux is everywhere\" sense. As the initiative\'s page puts it,  \"The LTSI tree is expected to be a usable base for the majority of embedded systems, as well as the base for ecosystem players (e.g., semiconductor vendors, set-vendors, software component vendors, distributors, and system/application framework providers).  ...  The goal is to reduce the number of private trees currently in use in the CE industry and encourage more collaboration and sharing of development resources.\" 	  	\nThe kernel team will take an LTS release 2-3 years out, but most enterprise-class distros will provide least 5 years of support. RHEL 5 was released in March 2007 and with Extended Lifecycle Support it\'ll last to November 2020 so that\'s 13.5 years. And at that point I\'d just sign up for the CVE list and see if there\'s any critical and relevant bugs for the most recently supported kernel that needs backporting, my guess is that it\'d be once a leap year from there on out.

The twist is that the immigrant workers are not your nice local visiting foreign guy from the university who wants to stick around \'cause he likes the people here... they are employees of foreign-based consulting companies in the business of collecting H1-B visas and \"import[ing] workers for large contracts to take over entire in-house technology units.\"  The other twist?  The U.S. tech workers are required to train their replacements before vacating their jobs, or risk losing severance benefits (excerpts of the Disney\'s layoff notice are included in the article). 	  	\nMy former co-workers said it mostly affected the QA and Load Test teams  (I left a few months before it all went down while workload was up and morale was already low).   Which is a shame, since those were things Disney really did well.  There were a lot of times that someone from those groups would catch issues in a deployment before a release, or even help reassure us that things were working properly in production.\nDisney was on a big automation and accountability binge when I left, though.  I can see why they\'d want to outsource QA/LT to another company that they can point their finger at when things go wrong.  When QA/LT is in-house, then (as TFA mentions) it\'s a big overhead and they only \"save money\" when things go right (but not in a way that actually hits the books).  With an outsourced QA/LT firm, they can probably arrange things so they can charge the external vendor penalties when things go wrong and bugs slip through.  Disney is clever like that.\nAnyway I feel sadly for my fallen comrades, but with all of the experience and grinding they did at Disney I\'m sure they\'ll fall someplace better.  I\'m actually more worried about the health and sanity of the H1Bs.  As TFA mentioned, it was the outsourcing company that was responsible for hiring and bringing on the H1Bs.  What they didn\'t mention is that a lot of the in-house Disney QA and even Devs that we worked with are already in completely foreign offices in the Philippines, Mexico, and Argentina, working US office hours.  So this isn\'t exactly news... just SOP after moving their new website from development/hypercare to sustainment.\nHere\'s how it *really* works:\nFirst, realize that the largest two companies who hoover up H1-B visas are... companies HQ\'d in India. Infosys and Tata, to be specific, who combined swallow the vast majority of the visas. They in turn offer their \'consultants\' to companies like Disney on a contract basis. This in turn means that Disney actually pays way less per head... here\'s why:\n* The contractor status of each H1-B means that Disney no longer has to pay the 401k/insurance/regulatory/etc costs that they would have to pay an employee, thus cutting their base cost per head by roughly half.\n* To comply with your assertion (which is correct, BTW), Disney pays Tata/Infosys something like 110% of the typical posted (not actual, but \"posted\") salary for the job per head, thus fulfilling your requirement, but still saving Disney roughly half the cost per head or more, depending on what they were paying the guy that the H1-B replaced.\n* Tata/Infosys in turn pay their \'consultants\' a pittance - say 50-70% of what they get - which generates profit for them.\nYou left out the best part.  After all these savings, productivity drops precipitously.  And it stays down, because what these Indian outsourcers are pushing (the one I worked with is Cognizant) is \'flexibility\'.  They tell the US company that they can provide a workforce that ramps up to handle any project you throw at them.  But in order to do that, they \'train\' a pool of workers and then rotate them off of the project.  The result of this is that the workers on a project at any given time are by design never experienced in the particulars of the given system they\'re working on.  They can provide absolutely no creativity to the process, and in fact, will spin their wheels on a wrong aproach for weeks before asking for help and revealing how little they know.  They\'re only human, after all, and they\'ve been thrown into a project cold and are being evaluated based on metrics that have little to do with actually producing working code.\nIn our case, the outsourced projects included custom in-house platforms.  And the Indian workers spent much of their time watching videos of us teaching the first round of them our jobs.  I know this, because I was hired by the contractors to be the one \'employee\' that actually knew how to do the work - and who did the lion\'s share of it.  That\'s the other dirty secret - they hire a few key ex employees to maintain a semblance of continuity.\nAlso, in our case, none of this really mattered.  It turned out that the company was for sale, and the real purpose of the outsourcing was to make the financials look better for the sale to a private equity firm.  The eventual buyers probably knew they were buying a dog - but not how much of a dog they were buying.  Now that they\'ve realized the extent of it, they\'re dropping their plans for an IPO and firing the rest of us so they can milk whatever profitability is left from existing customer contracts.  The empty hulk will be abandoned when those contracts run out - and the private equity guys will have gotten their money back.  Nothing lost - except a viable company and a bunch of American jobs...\nI was in the position of being trained by such a person once. I wasn\'t an immigrant, but the guy had been demanding more and more money over the years and they decided to get someone cheaper in, which turned out to be me. He really wasn\'t interested in training me at all, and it was a nightmare. I hated it because I wasn\'t good at my job, because I had no training or knowledge of the company\'s systems. Lots of jargon and stuff outside my normal field to learn, which would have been fine if it were possible to learn. There wasn\'t even documentation to refer to.\nI\'ve trained my replacement before. Or I should say I trained my replacements before. My sysadmin job was sliced and diced to be done by multiple \"teams\". User account management? Separate team. Storage? Separate team. Backups? Separate team. You get the picture. Another admin and I conducted more than one online training session for each of these teams and those were followed up by two (count \'em!) in-person visits by several members of each of the teams. After my end date came around, the outsourcing company hired me on as a contractor (at about the same as I was making but I actually made out pretty well since the contract work was entirely remote and I had zero transporation costs). For the better part of four years I was still doing most of the work that was supposed to have been farmed out to these teams. Everything these teams were supposed to be doing was taking 2-3 times longer as tasks would sit and sit and sit in the queue until some manager got me involved. It was rather pathetic. Cost savings? Where? Well, I guess my previous employer didn\'t have to pay out my bonus anymore and I wasn\'t taking paid vacation time.\nYou cant credibly just claim that taxes are the cause of every issue and expect it to be taken at face value. Do you really think that taxes are the only reason why Disney can save huge amounts by outsourcing from the US to India? Sure a combination of taxes, worker rights etc, combined with much lower living costs in India may justify it, but do you really want to slash the services provided by government and allow American firms to disregard worker safety and rights to the same extent as India, in the likely false hope that it will stop firms moving labour abroad where they can.\nVery obviously whoever made this smart decision never had to do a hostile takeover of an internal project. You get all the information you ask for, not one word more. You don\'t know what questions to ask? Wow, sucks to be you.\nI really doubt it will be any different in this case. They will give them all the information they have to relay to ensure they cannot be considered hostile, while leaving out everything that \"they assumed that the new guy already had to know\". It\'s just common sense, ya know? Everyone knows that. Ask around in the office, everyone will tell you that this is something you really don\'t have to spell out simply because it\'s OBVIOUS. It\'s not to your new hire? Gee, maybe you should have hired someone who knows his trade? Ok, I\'ll make sure the new tech will learn everything from now on and explain it all to him. Ok. Look, new guy. This here we call a hammer...\nBy law the H1B should not be cheaper than hiring Americans. They need to demonstrate they are paying prevailing wages and that they have made good faith effort to recruit Americans. But the companies game the system thoroughly. They lobby the congress to create strict dead lines like, \"if there is no reply from immigration side for 90 days the application is deemed to be approved\" and they the congress cuts the budget and staff of the immig department. They pad up the qualification requirements on one hand, \"degree in math/engineering, x years of experience in y technology blah blah blah\", then on the payment side they name the positions that have low pay. Naturally they would not find qualified Americans willing to work at that pay. \n  The way around these issues should be to create some sort of bounty program. Let the government crowdsource it. Make these H1B applications and the documentation supplied by these companies public. Any one should be able to challenge and point out the \"gaming\". There should be some sort of reward for people who catch them cheating. There should be some safe guards against frivolous challenges, and this program could be revenue neutral by making the cheaters pay for this by fines. \n In some fields in some ways H1-B applications are legitimate. People who come to USA, get a degree from accredited US university who work in the field they got their degrees in are not to be confused with these body shopping companies that import people with degrees from diploma mills in India. Indians who came in the early 1990s with degrees from top univs like IITs, IISc, TIFR, AIIMS, RECs and got further degrees in US universities earned the good will and the reputation for Indian engineers. Now all that is being squandered by these cheap body shoppers gaming the system bringing ill-repute to all Indian Americans.\nThese are all well and good valid points, but allow me to respond from the perspective of an Executive, as I\'m privy to quarterly and yearly financial reviews at the company level. Labor is the single biggest cost driver of most any American company. And it keeps growing year over year. At one IT company I worked for, labor costs grew anywhere between 6 and 10% per year, and that was with relatively high turnover in entry-level jobs. The drivers of these costs were the experienced senior personnel who are with the company for years, who negotiate for and get the bonuses and raises they arguably deserve. They also tend to manage to negotiate to be at the top of the pay scale for their profession/age/region. All good, right? No--because of wage creep. Wage creep means that because salaries must always go up for retained employees, labor costs must always go up. And companies are forced to decide between increasing labor load per employee to unmanageable levels, raising their product/service pricing above and beyond an acceptable level of inflation that the market will allow, or finding any legality/loophole they can to reduce headcount through layoffs, outsourcing, and bringing in H1Bs. As overworking employees tends to lead to poor morale and people leaving for greener pastures, increasing headcount means increasing COGS and OCOGS beyond what current revenues and profit margins will allow for, often the only alternative is to go to the Indian contracting houses and outsource IT personnel because middle-aged experienced native IT people are a massive cost center to the company. And that\'s not even taking into account the \"good enough\" expectations of clients who don\'t need perfection in their expectations of the product/service being delivered, or the banks who monitor the company\'s EBIDTA because they provide the operational cash flow, or the Wall Street analysts that work for momentum stock-preferring investment houses and watch expenses like a hawk, and whose recommendations or condemnations can trigger hordes of angry calls by shareholders straight to the CEO--and let me tell you, the REAL power in America is concentrated in the shareholders. You, me, everyone who has a 401K or stock options or owns stock, we demand growth at all costs. There\'s a poster downthread who talks about how legal laws will bow to economic forces and that this cannot be stopped. That poster is right--this process CANNOT be stopped. The days of American IT workers commanding above-average salaries for their work are numbered and fading away. This change is coming, it cannot be stopped, and it doesn\'lt matter that many of the big employers lied to get this. This would have come regardless. Change IS happening, but it\'s not necessarily the fault of big bad CEOs and faceless Mr. Smiths--it is the turbulence of the world at play.\nThis appears to be a very short-sighted way of looking at the cost drivers of this company. The real cost driver is that your labor requirements have been increasing each year, and instead of hiring more entry level workers you have invested in experienced staff that can improve company efficiency. If done well, these experienced workers can reduce your hiring needs by far more than the meager 6-10% raises they have been given. If done poorly, you are wasting those raises on ineffective senior level employees.\nWage creep is similar to scope creep; a small amount is inevitable but proper management can keep it mostly at bay.  If someone\'s wages are going up faster than inflation, they better be bringing more value than they did last year. Paying people more just because of seniority is idiotic. But seniority usually comes with increased knowledge of a company\'s business processes which does make them more valuable, so increased seniority usually comes with deserved raises above inflation. But your total wages should only go up if your total labor requirements go up. If labor requirements don\'t go up, and your senior employees are getting better at their jobs, it means there should be corresponding terminations to lower wages because you don\'t need as many employees anymore.\nIt should be illegal because the point of H1-B is \'we can\'t find local skill to fill the position, we had to go overseas to get it\'.  The fact that you already *have* the skills and are laying them off to *replace* with H1-B workers means you are violating the intent of the H1-B program.\n' WHERE `entries`.`id` = 68
